00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,570
Feel free to eat any evil spirits you see.

116
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,330
Mob, do you sense anything?

117
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,280
Yes, though it's faint.

118
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,700
Nope, not a damn thing.

119
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,160
Why the hell did you close the window, you jerk?!

120
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,750
But there definitely seems to be a stalker...

121
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,180
What kind of interest would a ghosthave in a living woman?

122
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,510
Beats me. It's pretty rare for spiritsto have any sexual desires left.

123
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,760
It's not like they can reproduce anymore.

124
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,850
But does love always have to come with sexual desires?

125
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,100
Actually, I don't want todiscuss this with you.

126
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,980
Right back at you, ya jerk.

127
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,860
Is this... a poltergeist?

128
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,320
What do I do? It must be madI called you here.

129
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,500
Did it settle down?

130
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,000
Outside the window!

131
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,420
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

132
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,510
Mob! Vaporize it!

133
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,880
That's...

134
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,050
a living person.

135
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,510
So it is a stalker!

136
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,220
Damn it! He disappeared!

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,860
He's in the next apartment.

138
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,180
{\fs12}Who are these people? Why are they here?

139
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,300
{\fs12}It's not like I did anything wrong.

140
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,410
I mean, yeah, I'm sorry I used an out of body experience to spy on you.

141
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,580
But I seriously fell for you at first sight!

142
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,070
I've never felt like this before... I didn't know what to do.

143
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,410
Y-Yeah... I'm serious about this.

144
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,010
I'm going to go out with her!

145
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,550
Don't get in my way! I'll murder you!

146
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,300
Why, you—

147
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,510
You pervy peeping tom!

148
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,470
Ow, ow, owie!

149
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,090
Say no to violence! Let me go! I'll call the cops, you bastard!

150
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,310
What are you talking about?

151
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,850
I'm sorry! I was in the wrong! I'll never do it again!

152
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,070
Please forgive me!

153
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,130
My feelings for you are genuine, though!

154
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,760
So, please... p-p-p-p...

155
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,960
You're seriously...

156
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,620
You're seriously insanely creepy!

157
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,080
I can't believe I was scared of {\i1}that{\i0}.

158
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,740
So he tried to hide his stalking tendenciesbehind a supernatural phenomenon.

159
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,510
Don't try that at home, Shigeo.

160
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,940
Why?

161
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,780
Why does she feel so differently after findingout it was a human and not an evil spirit?

162
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,730
I don't understand...

163
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,020
Man, he's got a lot on his mind today.

164
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,090
Guess I'll pick his brain later.

165
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,700
All right, let's head backand grab some soba on the way.

166
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,570
Okay...

167
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,320
Oh, there he is!

168
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,580
We were waiting for you!

169
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,180
Hey, you sure got him working a long part-time shift today.

170
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,050
Three jobs in one day?

171
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,790
That website is paying off.

172
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,330
We want to make some memories before we graduate, man!

173
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,950
So, like, we want to go to some popular haunted place and take a spirit photo.

174
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,020
But it'd suck if we actuallyran into an evil spirit.

175
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,300
So they're just messing around.

176
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,380
But it's not like I'm going to turn them down.

177
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,520
When and where?

178
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,440
Right now, my dude! We've got a car waiting just outside!

179
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,910
They definitely don't have a plan in mind.

180
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,070
What happened to getting there in20 minutes? It's already been 30.

181
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,860
I think it might take another 30.

182
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,780
We might not have time for soba after all.

183
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,850
So who the heck are you? His assistant?

184
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,110
I'm a part-timer.

185
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,760
You work part-time at a psychic's office? That's hilarious.

186
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,000
How much do you—

187
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,000
Mob!

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,920
Concentrate. Make sure you're prepared for the unexpected.

189
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,670
Right...

190
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,000
Wow, you sound legit!

191
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,870
We're here.

192
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,920
Yo! This place is creepy AF!

193
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,990
OMG! I'm so excited!

194
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,980
Holy shit, man.

195
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,980
Holy shit.

196
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,340
You sense any spirits?

197
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,640
Faintly...

198
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,850
Doesn't deserve to bea popular haunted spot, though.

199
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,870
All right, hurry up and take that picture, please.

200
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,180
Got it!

201
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,510
I'm taking it!

202
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,890
Okay, say chee— Actually, could you take it?

203
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,580
I want to vehemently decline, but they're customers, so what can I do?

204
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,610
Okay, say chee—

205
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,980
Oh, hey, don't forget the flash!

206
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,060
Okay, say cheese.

207
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,640
We should head back. My disciple's still in middle school.

208
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,850
Sure, thanks.

209
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,410
TYVM.

210
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,410
Thanks.

211
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,910
Also, regarding the fee...

212
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,530
What? Fee?

213
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,240
What are you even talking about?

214
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,910
What? The fee for this job.

215
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,640
Nothing bad happened, and youdidn't even do anything, psychic dude!

216
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,880
You really want us to pay you for nothing?

217
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,610
Isn't that a scam?

218
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,840
Yeah, like, a total scam!

219
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,550
No pay, and then...

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,830
Not even a ride back?

221
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,020
Yup. I'd say the unexpected just happened.

222
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, well. Let's head out to the road and hail us a taxi.

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,480
No soba tonight.

224
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,070

226
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,720
Hey!

227
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,240
Hey, kid!

228
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,750
You ignoring me? Hey!

229
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,660
Look at you, stumbling around. You're in our way.

230
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,510
But since you're here, could you lend us some cash?

231
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,430
Huh? But I don't have any.

232
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,990
Why you freakin' out?

233
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,850
Could you bring us some money tomorrow, then?

234
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,500
Huh?

235
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,810
You heard the guy.

236
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,830
Uh, Sugimoto?

237
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,910
Hey, what's wrong?

238
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,770
Why are you stripping, Sugimoto?!

239
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm an angel!

240
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,920
Sugimoto...

241
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,460
Dimple, stop! Stop that!

242
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,070
Sugimoto... Are you okay?

243
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,810
I dunno...

244
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,510
What just happened?

245
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,340
Let's try this again!

246
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,120
Hey, you little shit! You were laughing just now, weren't you?

247
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,440
I-I wasn't!

248
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,730
Shut up! You get what this is, right?

249
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,420
We're mugging yo—

250
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,770
Sugimoto?!

251
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,940
I'm okay! Let him go, Ritsu.

252
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,410
You sure?

253
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,790
They seem like a bad crowd.

254
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,440
Dude, what's wrong with you, Sugimoto?

255
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,320
Did you need something from our club member?

256
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,090
Huh?

257
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,030
Wh-Who the hell are you guys?!

258
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,510
Who said you could surround me like that, huh?

259
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,600
Bring it on, you bastards!

260
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,970
I'll kick yer asses!

261
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,690
Hey, stop squishing me, damn it!

262
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,420
Hey, I can't get out!

263
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,090
Hey!

264
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,110
Um, I'm fine, so please don't fight.

265
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,780
Fair enough.

266
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,780
Sugimoto!

267
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,360
You'll regret this, you jerks!

268
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,830
You sure you're all right?

269
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,450
Yes. Thank you.

270
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,220
You need to know when to fight back, Kageyama.

271
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,620
Or they're just going to try to bully you even more.

272
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,420
I can't think of a good way to.

273
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,630
Kick their asses with your shadow leader powers.

274
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,200
You don't have to waste your powerson guys like them, Nii-san.

275
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,350
If they show up again, I'll get rid of them.

276
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,810
Raking bad guys over the coals is what's good for them and society.

277
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,370
Make sure you kick their asses on your own next time.

278
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,270
You've got the power to do it.

280
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,160
What? You ended up with a spirit photo?

281
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,830
Yes... So we wanted to ask for your help again.

282
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,750
Just throw some salt around. I don't do volunteer work.

283
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,620
We're really sorry! We'll pay!

284
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,840
So what's the job?

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,950
We want to go back to that haunted place

286
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,260
and have you make the ghost in this picture disappear!

287
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,140
I mean, I can exorcise that photograph if you'd like.

288
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,060
We don't even need to go back to the place.

289
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,380
No way! It's creepy enough knowing that thing exists!

290
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,270
Please get rid of it!

291
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,630
So an exorcism request. Very well.

292
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,230
Let me explain the various options.

293
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,230
We'll take the most expensive one!

294
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,410
Looks like you got dragged out again.

295
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,390
And your Sunday got ruined yesterday.

296
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,980
You can get pissed off about this, y'know?

297
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,480
Please wrap this up as soon as possible.

298
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,730
There're three of them.

299
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,280
They don't seem to be evil spirits, though.

300
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,810
We'll just have to take care of them. They're scaring our clients.

301
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,000
Go ahead and exorcise them.

302
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,760
Please don't.

303
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,710
The three of us are family.

304
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,530
We died in an accident andlost our chance at a good life.

305
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,020
But now that we're ghosts,we've been living here peacefully.

306
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,970
We haven't done anything wrong.

307
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,160
I just want... to stay with my family a little bit longer.

308
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,030
As soon as this desire is fulfilled, we will disappear naturally.

309
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,660
So I beg of you... Please, let us be.

310
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,610
Did you hear that, Master?

311
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,480
Nope, not a thing.

312
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,960
Their aura must be too weak.

313
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,360
Th-There's no reason to exorcise them.

314
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,330
They said that they wouldn't do anything bad.

315
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,490
They're a family.

316
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,340
Hello?!

317
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,050
We called you here because we need you to exorcise them!

318
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,410
It's way too creepy knowing they're here!

319
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,860
Who cares if they do anything bad or not?

320
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,770
Not to mention, we said we'd pay you!

321
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,690
Hurry up and exorcise them already!

322
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,730
I'm getting goosebumps just standing here!

323
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,690
It's so creepy, I feel like I'm going to throw up.

324
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,870
What's the matter, Mob?

325
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,770
You've gotten rid of plenty of evil spirits before.

326
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,410
These people just want to live in peace.

327
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,370
I can't... I don't want to destroy that.

328
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,080
Just hurry up and do it already! No one cares how you feel!

329
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,150
Sir, we asked for your help because we really needed it.

330
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,010
Our customers always take top priority.

331
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,430
However, if spirits deserveas much respect as the living,

332
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,810
and the three here are truly just a family living peacefully...

333
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:51,180
Then I can't make Mob do something asheinous as barging in and dispatching them.

334
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,950
But our clients' fear is real, too.

335
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,120
What should I do?

336
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,910
As a professional, can I really put the ghosts above the clients?

337
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,630
Hey, man of the house.

338
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,750
I bet you've got plenty of pent-up spiritual power.

339
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,880
Dimple?

340
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,770
You gained that strength to protect your family, right?

341
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,510
In that case...

342
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,970
Why not kill those three right now?

343
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,820
They won't have to exorcise youif the clients are dead.

344
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,850
You want to live peacefully with your family, right?

345
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,320
Go on. What other choice do you have?

346
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,840
Darling...

347
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,670
Daddy...

348
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,300
I beg of you... Please let us be.

349
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,820
I cannot do something so horrific,

350
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,260
especially in front of my child...

351
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,220
I see. Well, what're you gonna do, then?

352
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,780
But we have nowhere left to run.

353
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,300
If you must go through with it, we'll just have to accept it.

354
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,580
But, please...

355
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,420
Please, I ask that you let us all go together,

356
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,570
wherever it may be.

357
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,700
Mob, are the spirits still saying something?

358
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,150
You...

359
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,240
Hey... So what's going on?

360
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,800
A moment, please.

361
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,930
What's wrong, Mob?

362
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,590
He's so against exorcising themthat it's making him tremble.

363
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,410
That much, huh?

364
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,800
Okay, got it. Let's skip the exorcism.

365
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,100
It's not like I'm ordering you.

366
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,900
It's okay to listen to your feelings.

367
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,160
Yup. You don't have to take this so seriously.

368
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,180
You're plenty strong, Shigeo.

369
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,270
I don't think you understand...

370
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,740
This must be something that only I understand...

371
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,240
I mean, there's no way I cango off my feelings alone.

372
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,530
I can't take this lightly.

373
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,900
If I truly decide to protect this family,

374
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,590
that'll mean the clients willhave to get hurt instead.

375
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,160
How long is this gonna take, damn it?!

376
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,630
Who cares what the brat—

377
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,260
Yo, what the hell is this? Salt?!

378
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,670
This concludes the exorcism.

379
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,570
What?

380
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,440
Wait, seriously?

381
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,220

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,190
We're done here.

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,140
Uh, okay.

385
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,660
So that's what's going on here... Why didn't I realize it sooner?

386
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,800
He can do so much more than an average person.

387
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,490
The world he can see is far bigger than ours.

388
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,750
Curses and spirits are a part of Mob's daily life.

389

Both the human and the inhumanare equally close to him.

Damn it!

391
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,880
It's all because I took too many jobs,got complacent, and half-assed things.

392

I wonder if anyone will yell at me for it.

433
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,370
Mob tried to think about everything that happened over the past two days,

434
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,720
but perhaps out of exhaustion, he immediately fell asleep.

435
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,070
Mob

436
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,940
We've been invited to a rich guy's house!

437
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,340
I smell a huge score!

438
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,000
We're gonna make that money, Mob!

439
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,750
Next time on {\i1}Mob Psycho 100 II{\i0} Episode 4:

440
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,580
"Inside ~Evil Spirit~."

441
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,300
{\c&H2F336F&\4c&H639951&}Inside~Evil Spirit~

442
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,300
A streaming service? But of course, that's an excellent decision!
