There isn't much of it.  148 00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,940 They rely on the tracking devices, so they don't have many guards posted.  149 00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,280 I'm sure they don't even patrol.  150 00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,620 Thank you.  151 00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,870 You're done?  152 00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,380 Yes.
