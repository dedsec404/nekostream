1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,230
Conny?

2
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,730
- Come on, wait for me!- Good morning!

3
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,900
Good morning!

4
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,860
Hey, Phil! No running!

5
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,110
Does this go here?

6
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,490
Yes, thank you.

7
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,280
Mark, can you set the table?

8
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,700
Okay, Mom!

9
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,960
Good morning, Emma!

10
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,670
Smile, Emma.

11
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,600
Listen, Emma.We have to behave like we normally do.

12
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,850
Yesterday, we broke the rulesand went to the gate.

13
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,020
But we didn't find anything.

14
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,980
But Little Bunny...

15
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,940
Yeah, Mom probably found it.But she doesn't know who left it there.

16
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,570
Mom was smiling.She doesn't show it on her face at all.

17
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,660
And that's what we have to do, too.

18
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,330
If our faces show it, Mom will notice.

19
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,330
We can't lose. Let's smile.

20
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:29,140
The delicious feed, the white clothes wheredirt can easily stand out, the well-regulated life...

21
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,640
This is all to maintainour quality as merchandise.

22
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,600
The only thing we can do is to waitas we are shipped out indiscriminately.

23
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,440
It's not indiscriminately.Remember what the demon said?

24
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,030
"Another six-year-old. We've beenshipping out normal quality ones."

25
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,240
What does that mean?

26
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,660
Judging from those words,age probably equals the grade of meat.

27
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,740
If I remember correctly,

28
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,460
the siblings who were shipped outwere between six and twelve years old.

29
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,630
If being six years old is ranked as normal,then the highest quality is...

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,170
Twelve years old.

31
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,960
But what about our scores?

32
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,800
Meat won't taste better even if we getgood scores on tests, right?

33
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,180
Yeah. It was never announcedunless we got full scores, but maybe...

34
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,470
The order of getting shipped out?

35
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,600
After we turn six, we get harvestedstarting from the lower test scores.

36
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,400
And when we turn 12,we get shipped out no matter what.

37
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,070
So we were never shipped outbecause we have full scores?

38
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,120
But I don't understandwhy it depends on our scores.

39
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,370
Is there meaning for being betweenthe age of six and twelve?

40
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,830
The size of our bodies?

41
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,880
No. Then it would depend on our weight.

42
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,380
The size of our brains.

43
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,840
That means...

44
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,550
The brain probably tastes the best.

45
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,430
{\an8}And the more developed brain, the better.

46
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,020
{\an8}Eating... the brain?

47
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,770
{\an8}And they don't carehow much they risk or spend.

48
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,060
{\an8}That's why we're high-quality merchandise.

49
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,690
{\an8}Try to remember, Emma.

50
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,490
{\an8}Conny was shipped out. Before her was Hao.

51
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,320
{\an8}Before him was Sadie.

52
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,450
{\an8}Based on the cycle so far, the next shipmentshould be two months from now at the earliest.

53
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,420
{\an8}We need to think of a wayfor all of us to escape before then.

54
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,680
If we draw a simple map of this site,the House is in the middle and then the gate.

55
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,220
And the forest that surrounds us.

56
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,270
First, which one should we escape from?The gate or the forest?

57
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,190
Maybe the forest?

58
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,110
The gate is always closed except during shipping,and when it's open...

59
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,650
The demons are there.

60
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,150
When do we escape through the forest?

61
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,910
At playtime, during the day,when we can get out of the House freely?

62
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,580
Or at night during shipping when Mom is not—

63
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,500
Not during shipping!Someone will definitely get sacrificed.

64
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,790
Right.

65
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,420
And I'm worried if the younger onescan stay awake at night.

66
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,300
Then it's decided.

67
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,510
We'll escape during the day through the forest.Whether that's possible...

68
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,140
Depends on what it's like beyond the forest.

69
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,530
Norman!

70
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,120
Norman! Are you okay?

71
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,120
I guess I'm tired from thinking too much.

72
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,290
Sheesh, I guess it can't be helped.

73
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,760
So? Is something there?

74
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,220
Nothing.

75
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,220
But this wall is about two to three meters thick.

76
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,760
And it's pretty tall.

77
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,730
But there are no guards.

78
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,480
It's quiet.

79
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,730
What do you think?

80
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,230
It's hard and sturdy.

81
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,490
There are no edges, let alone any seams.

82
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,740
And the surface is smooth.

83
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,990
There's no way anyone could climb this.

84
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,910
Then should we give up?

85
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,460
But that's what this wall would have us think.

86
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,500
If it was you or me,we could climb it as long as we had a rope.

87
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,540
I don't sense any demons around.

88
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,510
The only one watching us is Mom.

89
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,590
Don't worry. It's not scary.

90
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,480
Huh? Two kids are missing.

91
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,980
Mom!

92
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,980
Mark!

93
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,770
Did something happen?

94
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,490
What should I do?I got separated from Naila in the forest!

95
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,740
I tried looking, but I couldn't find her!

96
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,120
It'll be okay.

97
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,290
Everyone, stay here.

98
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,960
Understood?

99
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,760
Mom.

100
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,060
Mom!

101
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,350
Naila!

102
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,860
She got tired and fell asleep.

103
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,860
Look, not a scratch on her.

104
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,690
Thank goodness!

105
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,030
I'm so sorry, Naila. I'm sorry!

106
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,950
It was like Mom knewexactly where Naila was.

107
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:51,000
Come to think of it,Mom has always been good at finding us.

108
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,040
No matter where we hid, she found us quickly.

109
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,710
That's not a pocket watch.

110
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,220
Tracking devices.

111
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,510
They could be implantedsomewhere in our bodies.

112
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,350
And Mom used the compact and purposelyshowed us so we would figure it out.

113
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,980
"No matter who it is, I won't let you escape."

114
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,060
That's probably what Mom wants to say.

115
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,110
Mom is...

116
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,740
...an enemy.

117
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,460
First, let's get our hands on some rope.I have an idea where they might be.

118
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,050
I'll see you tonight at 10 in the hallway.

119
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,300
Wait!

120
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,180
They have tracking devices on us,

121
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,050
so what if they have other stuff,like cameras or listening devices?

122
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,680
It's all right.

123
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,430
I looked around a bit,and there was nothing like that here.

124
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,560
When did you do that?

125
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,190
But I should have known.

126
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,570
The security measuresaren't on the building, but on us.

127
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,780
Do you think Mom knows already?

128
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,450
That we went all the way to the wall...

129
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,240
I don't think so.

130
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,790
I mean, she didn't knowabout that other time, either.

131
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,620
When we went to deliver Little Bunny.

132
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,080
That's true.

133
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,000
It's not like Mom always knowswhere we are at all times.

134
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,960
She'll know our location only when she checks.

135
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,720
She knows that Little Bunny was broughtto the gate by someone other than Conny.

136
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,010
But I don't think she figured out who it was.

137
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,100
Or else she wouldn't have warned usin such a roundabout way.

138
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,980
I see.

139
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,810
Hey, Norman!

140
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,190
Do you have a second?

141
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,480
The clock isn't quite working properly.

142
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Okay, I'll take a look.

143
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,570
It'll be okay, Emma.

144
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,030
We're not being suspected.

145
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,460
Conny.

146
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,720
Em—

147
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,430
What's wrong, Emma?

148
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,020
You look pale.

149
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,530
Which reminds me,you weren't so cheerful this morning.

150
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,240
That's not...

151
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,000
It's nothing.

152
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,630
I just got a little sad thinking thatI’ll leave the House soon, too.

153
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,800
Do you like it here at the House?

154
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,680
I love the House and you, Mom!

155
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,810
I wonder what Conny's doing right now?

156
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,780
Conny said she wanted to bea mother like you when she grew up.

157
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,410
Yes, I know.

158
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,580
I'm sure Conny will become a lovely adult,

159
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,710
and a good mother, too.

160
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,760
Dinner preparations are ready, Mom.

161
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,890
I'll be right there.

162
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,970
Wait for me!

163
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,060
Hurry!

164
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,100
Emma, let's go.

165
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,770
Okay.

166
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,770
Did the two of you...

167
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,190
go to the gate yesterday?

168
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,150
We didn't. That's against the rules.

169
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,700
Besides, we were having too much funplaying tag yesterday. Right?

170
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,870
Yeah!

171
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,910
Why?

172
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,870
It's nothing. As long as you didn't go.

173
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,140
Can you stand up?

174
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,080
This was a really good idea, Norman.

175
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,910
Using tablecloths.

176
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,120
This can be used as rope.

177
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,510
With this, we can get over the wall.

178
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,760
Okay. The challenge is still ahead of us.

179
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,810
Where the tracking devices are...

180
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,850
...and a way to get everyone out.

181
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,020
Hey, Norman.

182
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,020
I think it might be fine if we told Ray.

183
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,070
I was thinking that, too.

184
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,150
Ray most likely wouldn't panic.

185
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,950
And because of his extensive knowledge,he's good with machines, too.

186
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
I'm sure we can depend on him.

187
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,870
But...

188
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,830
But?

189
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,330
I'll talk to Ray myself.

190
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,040
Why don't you go back, and—

191
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,000
Why?

192
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,130
Ray!

193
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,210
Yo.

194
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,430
Sorry, I followed you guys.

195
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,600
It's been bugging me for a while,so I thought I should ask about it.

196
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,070
{\an8}What happened at the gate that night?

197
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,490
{\an8}When you went to go deliverLittle Bunny to Conny.

198
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,610
{\an8}You were both clearly acting weird.

199
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,490
{\an8}And you were empty-handedwhen you said you didn't make it.

200
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,830
{\an8}You're perceptive.

201
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,410
{\an8}So of course something happened. Give it up.

202
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,500
{\an8}Ray is smart, too, after all.

203
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,590
Demons... A farm...

204
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,350
Mom is an enemy?

205
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,890
Isn't this bad?

206
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,060
He catches on fast!

207
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:10,060
So you're saying we were preciouslytaken care of to become demon food.

208
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,230
I mean...

209
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,940
I'm surprised you're believing us so easily.

210
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,990
Of course. Norman wouldn'tmake up such a stupid lie.

211
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,990
{\an8}It'd be different with you, Emma.

212
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,750
So, if we're really going to escape,there are various issues.

213
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,580
First, the number of kids.

214
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,590
- We'll narrow it down to who can make it and—- Wait!

215
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,920
{\an8}I want to escape with everyone.

216
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,130
Lend us your strength, Ray!

217
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,600
{\an8}Everyone?

218
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,180
{\an8}You're kidding, right?

219
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,100
{\an8}There are 37 of us.

220
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,400
{\an8}And the majority are under six years old.

221
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,310
Mom.

222
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,610
Demons.

223
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,770
Tracking devices.

224
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,900
These factors make an already difficult escapeeven more challenging.

225
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,320
I know that.

226
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,740
But it's not impossible—

227
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,990
No, it's impossible.

228
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,870
Emma, you haven't noticed, have you?

229
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,700
Ray, wait.

230
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,000
I see. That's why you saidyou'll talk to me yourself.

231
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,420
{\an8}You have to be bluntabout these kinds of things.

232
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,500
{\an8}Emma.

233
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,340
{\an8}What?

234
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,050
It won't be enough just to escape from here.

235
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,720
What do you mean?

236
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,600
We don't know what it's like on the outside.

237
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,890
But there's a place we're getting shipped to.

238
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,690
Because there's a farm,that should give you an idea.

239
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,730
What waits outside is a demon's society.

240
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,400
There is no place for humans to live.

241
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,150
{\an8}So it's impossible.

242
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,280
{\an8}If we take everyone, we'll all die.

243
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,990
We leave them behind. That's the best option.

244
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,250
No way.

245
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,790
{\an8}Even if it's impossible,I want to escape with everyone.

246
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,920
{\an8}Let's figure it out.

247
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,510
I don't want all of us to die.But there's no option to leave them behind.

248
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,930
I want Conny to be the last.

249
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,810
I don't want anyoneto end up like that ever again.

250
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,850
If there isn’t one, then let's makea place for humans to live outside.

251
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,810
Let's change the world.

252
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,440
{\an8}I understand now, thanks to you, Ray.

253
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,610
{\an8}That's the kind of prison break we have to do.

254
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,530
{\an8}I'm not giving up on this.

255
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,320
{\an8}Because I've decided.

256
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,450
So, Ray, you're the one who has to give up.Stop jabbering around and help us!

257
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,840
Hey, Guardian, how can—

258
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,130
We'll escape with everyone, no matter what!

259
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,630
Or else I won't do it. I won't! I won't!

260
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,300
Do something about that idiot!She's unreasonable.

261
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,890
I know, right? But I'm glad she's so cheerful.

262
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,100
I wanted for you to stop her!Or you're both going to die.

263
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,770
You knew that from the very start, huh?

264
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,190
Emma was crying.

265
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,200
That night, I thought she was cryingbecause she was scared.

266
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,610
But I was wrong.

267
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,030
I was scared of dying.

268
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,710
But Emma was crying becauseshe was scared of her family dying.

269
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,340
Isn't that amazing? She thinks ofprotecting others in that situation.

270
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,460
But it's not the correct thing.

271
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,470
It's a boat made of mud!And it's just us three, right?

272
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,430
If it's just us, we can escape.

273
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,890
You're correct, and you shouldn't feel ashamed.

274
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,810
Don't distort your decisionbased on emotions, Norman!

275
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,560
It's not that, Ray.

276
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,730
I also want to make a boat out of mud.

277
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,740
Why? Aren't you different?

278
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,610
You're more cool-headed,and you always take the best option.

279
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,700
So, why?

280
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,160
Because I like her.

281
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,450
I like Emma, so that's whyI want her to always be smiling.

282
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,830
You're crazy.

283
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,590
And what if Emma dies because of it?

284
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,460
I won't let her die.

285
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,630
That's why I'm going to utilize myself.

286
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,850
Luckily, I've always managedto accomplish what I set out to do.

287
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,020
And if you bake mud, it'll become a vessel.

288
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,350
A boat made out of mud won't necessarily sink.

289
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,060
{\an8}You're nuts.

290
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,440
{\an8}Maybe. Both Emma and I are insane.We've completely lost it.

291
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,820
{\an8}You can't let us do this on our own, right?

292
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,490
{\an8}Damn it.

293
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,000
{\an8}Of course I can't.

294
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,710
Ray. Norman.

295
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,500
We still have free time left, don't we?

296
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,840
I wonder what it is.

297
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,350
Let me introduce her.

298
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,850
This is your newest little sister, Carol.

299
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,560
And this is Sister Krone. She's here to help me.

300
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,860
A-An adult?

301
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,650
Another enemy.

302
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,740
I will be living here with all of youstarting today. It's nice to meet you.

303
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,080
- It's nice to meet you.- Hello!
