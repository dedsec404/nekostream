1
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,370
What are you saying?What's wrong, Norman?

2
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,960
You already know by now, right?

3
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,760
I set a trap for three people.

4
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,390
To Don, I said the rope was under my bed.

5
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,640
To Gilda, I saidthe second floor bathroom's ceiling.

6
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,270
That's what I told you, Ray.

7
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,650
But actually, I told Don it was in the dining hall,and told Gilda it was in the library.

8
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,900
Then, the ropethat was under my bed disappeared.

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,320
Then what about the other two locations?

10
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,280
Should we go check on them now?

11
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,760
Dang. And I thought I was doing so well.

12
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,270
That's right.

13
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,940
I am Mom's spy.

14
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,860
When did you start suspecting me?

15
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,900
The day Sister came to the House.

16
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,910
I was disgusted with myselffor thinking such a thing.

17
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,160
You were the first person I suspected.

18
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,950
Even though you're my friend.

19
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,670
I just wished it wasn't true.

20
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,210
It was my supposition for the worst case.

21
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,840
But for us, it would be the most problematicif you're the traitor.

22
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,800
And from the enemy's point of view, it would bethe most beneficial if you're the traitor.

23
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,520
You can give opinions to our plans,

24
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,480
and from the perspective of controllingthe situation, it's perfect.

25
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,100
No one else fit the job better.

26
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,190
And that's why you suspected me.

27
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,320
And that's how I walked into your trap, huh?

28
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,910
One more thing.

29
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,240
Ray, you're not a traitorwho was set up just for this matter, right?

30
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,790
Mom would never trust a sudden tipor an impromptu spy.

31
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,040
How long have you been Mom's spy?

32
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,090
From a long time ago.

33
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,010
I've been Mom's subordinate for a long time.

34
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,680
Basically, a sheepdog for a shepherd.

35
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,600
You knew about everythingand assisted Mom this whole time?

36
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,600
Yeah.

37
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,480
Was everything a lie?

38
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,570
All the time spentpreparing for things with Emma and me?

39
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,070
What and how much did you tell Mom?

40
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,530
The tracking devices can be broken, right?

41
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,580
What's the point in asking that?

42
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,870
Depending on the answer, will you cut me off?

43
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,670
I won't. I'll have you by our side,as you've always been.

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,300
Aren't you glad? You can continueto hide the mistake you made.

45
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,720
You wanted to keep spying on us,even if it meant framing Don, right?

46
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,590
What do you want?

47
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,840
Three things.

48
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,100
One, continue to spend time with us like beforeand guarantee our safety.

49
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,100
Two, release all the information you have to us.

50
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,110
Three, come to our side.

51
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,440
Can you become my spy?

52
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,610
You want me to be the ace up your sleeve?

53
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,450
Yeah.

54
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,070
Are you an idiot?

55
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,740
If that was your objective from the beginning,you should've kept quiet and used me.

56
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,410
Just forcibly utilize me and then abandon mewhen you execute the plan.

57
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,330
That would've been the better method.

58
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,750
You're right, but...

59
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,300
She said we're family that grew up together.

60
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,230
That's why I changed my mind.

61
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,650
I want to believe in you, too.

62
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,900
That you're my friend before my enemy.

63
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,400
Besides, you're the onewho hid Little Bunny, right?

64
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,910
That night when we went to the gate,if you hadn't said that we could make it

65
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,660
we wouldn't have gone.

66
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,170
You led us to discover the truthabout this House for ourselves.

67
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,800
You're the one who set upthis escape for our sake, right?

68
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,630
Ray, why are you being Mom's sheepdog?

69
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,260
Why?

70
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,510
You wouldn't do things to make us realize the truthif you were 100 percent Mom's dog.

71
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,730
You were controlling us.

72
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,190
The tracking devices, the timing of the escape,and how fast the plan progressed.

73
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,820
That's why you strongly opposedescaping ten days from now.

74
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,070
But at the same time,weren't you also keeping Mom under control?

75
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,290
You're not our enemy after all, right?

76
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,960
I volunteered. I went to her.

77
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,040
No, it's more accurate to saythat I sold myself.

78
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,210
It was all in preparation for this escape.

79
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,220
The most efficient way to learn about the enemyand gather things is from inside their pocket.

80
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,640
That's why I brought up a deal to Mom.

81
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,230
That's too dangerous.

82
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,730
I had chances to succeed.

83
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,730
Mom would want to avoid harvesting a top scorer,one she spent time and effort on, midway.

84
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,610
That's how I saw it.

85
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,240
She actually cares moreabout profit rather than rules.

86
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,740
I basically asked for two things.

87
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,750
One, I'll cooperate,so don't immediately ship me out.

88
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,460
Two, I asked for rewards if I gave results.

89
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,630
Rewards?

90
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,840
Just various junk.

91
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,960
If it wasn't available in the House,I had her obtain it.

92
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,890
I was testing what I could obtainand what was impossible.

93
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,140
I also wanted to probe the outside world.

94
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,060
As a result, she obtained a lot of things,as long as they weren't dangerous.

95
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,900
But they were all older models.

96
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,030
Then, when you said you had an ideaabout breaking the tracking devices...

97
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,400
I've seen the actual device.

98
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,540
I experimented, and after many years,I figured out how to break it.

99
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,540
The tracking devices can definitely be nullified.

100
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,040
Do you understand?

101
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,920
The person you see before youis the strongest card you have.

102
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,630
The tracking devices and Mom.

103
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:21,180
I have far more informationthan what's necessary for this escape.

104
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,810
I've been preparing ever sinceI found out the truth about the House.

105
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,650
Ray.

106
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,320
Without having anyone notice,I had you two go to the gate.

107
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,820
I did all this to make sureyou two don't get killed.

108
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,410
Just like you said, I'm not your enemy.

109
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,910
But I'm also not an ally.

110
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,420
Under one condition,I can completely become your ace.

111
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,300
I'll give you all the information I have,and I'll also leak lies to Mom like you want.

112
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,720
What's the condition?

113
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,090
Trick Emma.

114
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,680
You need to pretend we're taking everyone,but at the last moment, ditch them.

115
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,270
Even if we take others,it'll only be Don and Gilda.

116
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,560
So you're telling me to give up onescaping with everyone?

117
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,400
Yeah.

118
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,360
The training is helping everyone growmore than we expected.

119
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,980
You even said their movement isn't bad.

120
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,150
You meant that, right?

121
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,150
Then we can all—

122
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,950
It still doesn't change the factthat they're a burden.

123
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,450
You said you were going to help us.

124
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,710
And this is how I'm helping.

125
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,420
Otherwise, you and Emma can die here.

126
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,420
I thought you didn't want us to get killed.

127
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,430
If you're just going to get killed as soon aswe escape, it'd be better to get shipped out.

128
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,600
So? Will you accept my condition?

129
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,350
Fine.

130
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,200
If what you just said was a lie...

131
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,450
I know. It wasn't a lie.

132
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,360
You took a while.

133
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,570
I was talking to Norman.

134
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,740
And?

135
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,820
Nothing much has changed.

136
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,030
They're focused on training with tag.

137
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,870
The bigger issue is that Sister.

138
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,290
She's on the move again.

139
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,290
You should be careful.

140
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,620
I see.

141
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,880
You should have never summoned her.

142
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,050
That was supposed to bea deterrent for me, right?

143
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,380
It makes me sad that you still don't trust meeven though I've been helping you for six years.

144
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,180
It's just a precaution.

145
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,850
Besides, if you had made sure those twodidn't go to the gate that day,

146
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,060
this wouldn't be happening.

147
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,850
I apologized for that.

148
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,820
I never thought you'd be a useless dogwho couldn't even keep watch.

149
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,820
I made up for it by spying for you.

150
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,200
I sold out my best friends, and I reportSister Krone's disturbing behavior in detail.

151
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,790
So I'm going to get my reward.

152
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,790
Of course. That is the deal.

153
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,210
With everyone... Let's escape with everyone!

154
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,760
And of course, with Ray, too!

155
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,850
That's...

156
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,850
That's why I told you.

157
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,650
Emma!

158
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,730
Emma!

159
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,950
Everyone...

160
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,380
Norman, it's morning!

161
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,720
Good morning.

162
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,810
- So then I did this...- Good morning, Norman.

163
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,810
Good morning, Emma.

164
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,350
Good morning, Norman.

165
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,900
I brought the plates.

166
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,560
- Good morning, Ray.- Good morning, Emma.

167
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,150
So?

168
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,280
How did the plan with the ropes go?

169
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,240
Was there progressfor the source of information?

170
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,110
Actually...

171
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,620
Oh, that.

172
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,570
It's me.

173
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,290
I'm Mom's informant.

174
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,420
It was you?

175
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,380
Sorry for that reaction,but I still don't understand.

176
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,930
Yes! Let me explain!

177
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,560
So you're the traitor, but not an enemy.

178
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,560
You were acting as Mom's subordinateall this time for our sake?

179
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,980
Yeah.

180
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,400
The truth is, I was going to tell you everythingas soon as you got back from the gate.

181
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,990
But you left Little Bunny behind,

182
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,570
saying you wanted to escape with everyone,and other unexpected things happened.

183
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,790
Mom found out,so I had to manage the situation.

184
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,460
Plus you guys were being rash,and about to get reckless.

185
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,500
That's why I figured I should keep quietand get both under control.

186
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,460
So you're saying that youwere covering up for our mistakes.

187
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,550
And you're still againstescaping with everyone, right?

188
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,470
But it's different now.

189
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,180
I'll help you escape with everyone.

190
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,270
That's not like you.

191
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,190
Do you think he's lying?

192
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,940
No, I'm happy.

193
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,700
Ray is now going to help everyone escape.

194
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,990
And we also have informationto trick Mom from the inside.

195
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,450
It's awesome!

196
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,540
But, I see.

197
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,210
You knew about everythingfor a long time, huh?

198
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,050
It must have been painful.

199
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,460
Knowing and sending them offwithout saying anything.

200
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,970
So many of them.

201
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,720
Hey.

202
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,060
Were the experiments for the tracking devicesdone on someone's ear?

203
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,280
What happened to that child...or rather, children?

204
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,150
You didn't cause themto be shipped out early, did you?

205
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,830
You didn't sacrifice someonefor our sake, did you?

206
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,750
Actually, never mind. Thank you.

207
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,460
Thanks to that,we can all escape together now.

208
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,130
But...

209
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,920
don't do something like that ever again.

210
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,840
You're not alone anymore.

211
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,300
You're not alone anymore, so...

212
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,680
I swear. I'll never do it again.

213
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,560
Let's all escape from here together.

214
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,690
They're talking on their own again, huh?

215
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,780
Damn it, how long are theygoing to be discussing things?

216
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,200
We need to go save Conny!

217
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,240
I wonder if there's a reason.

218
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,490
Like what?

219
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,450
I don't know.

220
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,500
It's not just about being dangerousbecause we're dealing with bad people.

221
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,130
But something even more...

222
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,760
Emma sure was mad.

223
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,180
Hey, Ray.

224
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,260
I want to ask you something.

225
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,260
What?

226
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,270
You said you did itso that both of us don't get killed.

227
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,140
But are you actually...

228
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,150
Oh yeah!

229
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,900
I have something to report.

230
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,160
Gilda and I decided to properlyobserve Mom once again.

231
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,160
Mom disappears right beforeeight o'clock every night.

232
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,580
Disappears?

233
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,960
Yeah. She's nowhere to be found in the House.

234
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,920
This House has a secret room.

235
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,170
A secret room?

236
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,380
Yeah.

237
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,420
Located here.

238
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,970
Next to Mom's bedroom.

239
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,140
Mom's bedroom has the bathroomand washroom next to it.

240
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,810
Past that, continuing beyond the wallis Mom's office.

241
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,310
But this probably isn't a wall.

242
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,440
I noticed that every time Mom disappears,she always goes into her office or the washroom.

243
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,530
So I measured the distance inside the room,and the distance in the hallway.

244
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,990
Oh. That's what you were doing then.

245
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,870
Yeah.

246
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,910
And the result?

247
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,080
They didn't match.

248
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,080
There are about tenof my footsteps' worth of space.

249
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,590
One side is a wall,and the other side is a bookshelf.

250
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,840
But I think there arehidden doors on both sides.

251
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,970
And beyond that, there's a secret room.

252
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,600
But what is that for?

253
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,550
Probably—

254
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,970
Scheduled check-ins.

255
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,100
Mom does scheduled check-insto the headquarters every day.

256
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,770
The room is likely for that.

257
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,400
Headquarters?

258
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,360
The base that supplies babiesand sisters to this House.

259
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Ray, did you knowthat there was a room here?

260
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,610
No. Although I suspected the existence—

261
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,990
Let's try to get in.

262
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,620
It's a way to communicate with the outside,and find Conny and the others' whereabouts.

263
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,250
We might be able to find some clues!

264
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,870
But could we get in there so easily?

265
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,000
Even if it's difficult, we have to do it!

266
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,630
Hold on. There's no merit in going that far.

267
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,470
Even if it's a communication method,it's most likely only connected to headquarters.

268
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,890
And Mom doesn't knowwhere our siblings were sent.

269
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,390
It's not even an issue of finding clues.

270
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,770
And if we're careless, our tracking devicescould give away our position.

271
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,520
We don't knowwhat kind of security that room has.

272
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,860
It's too dangerous.

273
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,900
But...

274
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,820
I'm saying that the riskoverwhelmingly outweighs the merit.

275
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,110
You're right.

276
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,910
For now, be careful of the Sister.Don't dig your grave with a foolish move.

277
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,790
Exactly.

278
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,290
I have Mom under control,but we're doomed if the Sister finds out.

279
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,330
Keep that in mind when you act.

280
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,800
Don, can you go ahead to prepare for dinner?

281
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,010
- If someone doesn't go, Mom will—- I know.

282
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,400
Huh? Don, that way is...

283
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,780
Do you really intend to go in?

284
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,870
I can't stay calm like them.

285
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,250
And I want to know the real Mom.

286
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,820
There's a hidden door behind here.

287
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,830
How is this set up?

288
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,920
Is there even one here?

289
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,930
Damn it! I need to hurry and go save heras soon as possible!

290
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,850
Maybe...

291
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,230
Look closely at the shapes.

292
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Let's go.

293
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,620
It's locked.
