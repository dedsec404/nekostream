1
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,940
Please use this room.

2
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Understood, thank you.

3
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,030
She's settling down in a bad spot.

4
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,990
The center of the three children's rooms.

5
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,580
To make it easier for her to watch us...

6
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,970
I was distracted by the tracking devicesthat I didn't think we would get another adult.

7
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,970
Actually we should be happy about this.

8
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,600
What? Be happy?

9
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,930
Carol and Sister Krone.We have two more sources of information.

10
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,350
I see.

11
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,730
First, where did those two come from?

12
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,400
Carol is Conny's replacement.

13
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,530
So they're replenishing the merchandise.

14
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,240
Yeah, if this place is a farm,

15
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,280
they must have a site where theyprepare one-year-olds for replenishment.

16
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,290
So did all of us come from there originally?

17
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,040
Probably. And also that Sister Krone.

18
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,340
It's significant that there'sanother adult other than Mom.

19
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,340
There might be other farms just like here,

20
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,890
so are the adults who obey the demonsunder the control of demons from birth,

21
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,060
or after they're captured?

22
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,060
After we escape,things will change depending on that.

23
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,900
But first, we need to figure outhow to escape with everyone.

24
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,360
And the location of the tracking devices.

25
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,240
I searched all over my body, but I didn't findany traces of something implanted.

26
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,450
And nothing in our clothes or shoes.

27
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,040
Based on humankind's existing technology,it probably uses radio waves.

28
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,500
But that requires batteries.

29
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,830
Something really small that wouldn't leave a scar,and with batteries that last over 10 years.

30
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,760
That kind of product wouldn't exist in 2015.

31
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,010
Meaning?

32
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,800
It’ll be difficult to predict the mechanism,find the location, and figure out how to break it.

33
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,640
And we might as well give upif it's technology originating from the demons.

34
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,680
True.

35
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,060
What? So, checkmate?

36
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,690
Yup.

37
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,150
No way!

38
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,690
Well, even if we can't figure it out,we can guess.

39
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,150
Yeah. We have to thinkfrom the enemy's point of view.

40
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,200
Where and what kind of a devicewould be the most convenient to implant?

41
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,710
Carol!

42
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,550
Since she just arrived, she might have one.

43
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,300
A mark from implanting the tracking device.

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,390
Thank you for an opportunityto return to this side.

45
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,310
I only made a request for one assistant.

46
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,810
It's not like I called for you specifically.

47
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,570
I've heard of your many achievements.

48
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,990
The youngest to be selectedas Mom and caretaker.

49
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,280
You've raised the highest number of high-qualitygoods among all of the plants, ever.

50
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,160
I am honored to work undersomeone I admire so much.

51
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Lip service isn't necessary.

52
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,750
Let's quit the small talk,and talk about work instead.

53
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,550
Here are the documentsof my adorable children.

54
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
Memorize all of it, right now.

55
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,800
It should be easierthan getting perfect scores every morning.

56
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,310
By the way, what work was I called in for?

57
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,310
They found out about the secret.

58
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,480
They also saw the package in the truck.

59
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,610
Then, in accordance with the rules,we must find them and ship them imm—

60
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,780
Wait.

61
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,920
{\an8}It's fine. I already have an ideaof who the targets are.

62
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,420
{\an8}And that's...

63
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,420
{\an8}Two of the oldest children.

64
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,510
{\an8}We just have to make surethey don't escape before shipment.

65
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,260
{\an8}My children are special.

66
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,840
{\an8}And this is beneficial for the plant.

67
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,180
{\an8}So you're not reporting it?

68
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,970
{\an8}No. I will take care of the targetsin a proper manner.

69
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,600
{\an8}You are a guard.

70
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,650
{\an8}You don't need to think.Just watch the children.

71
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,270
{\an8}I am the Mom of this House.

72
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,860
{\an8}And you are my assistant.

73
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,740
Understand? Sister Krone.

74
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,620
Yes, ma'am, Isabella.

75
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,500
So that's how it is.

76
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,500
I was surprised, too.To think that the amazing Isabella...

77
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,970
And she's not reporting it to the higher-ups,but trying to cover up her mistake.

78
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:17,510
However, if I help her out here, she'll owe me,and I'll one day have the Mom position!

79
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,810
Oh my, what's wrong?

80
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,690
You're crying so much.

81
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,520
Come on now, don't cry.You'd be happy too, right?

82
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,480
If I became a Mom?

83
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,610
If that happens, I'll get busier,but you'll support me, right?

84
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,080
Don't get jealous of the other childrenand say selfish things, okay?

85
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,200
Wait a minute.

86
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,330
Could this be my chance?

87
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,460
I can become a Mom!

88
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,130
Not one day, but now!

89
00:06:52,970 --> 00:07:01,060
If I capture the children who know the secretand report her violation, Isabella will be fired!

90
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,940
It would be faster to pretend to obey herand then take her position away!

91
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,030
Capture the targets!

92
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,740
And then snitch!

93
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,910
Then immediately ship them out!

94
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,700
Wonderful!

95
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,450
I'll become the Mom here.

96
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,620
I need to find them quickly.

97
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,000
The kids like her.

98
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,970
Yeah. How do we outmaneuverthe two adults who are liked so much?

99
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,720
Exactly.

100
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,140
The biggest concernis the report to the demons.

101
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,560
As soon as we escape,the monsters will come after us.

102
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,730
There's only one way to stop that.

103
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,020
Mom and Sister will have to be...

104
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,240
Norman and Ray, right?

105
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,490
Yes.

106
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
I heard you get perfect scores on the tests.

107
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,210
Yes.

108
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,420
That's amazing.

109
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,540
It's nice to meet you. I hope we can get along.

110
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
Did she hear us?

111
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,100
No, we're fine.

112
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,110
I don't think that sister came herejust to watch us.

113
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,650
What do you mean?

114
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,280
The way she looked at us was different.

115
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,860
She's probably suspecting us,the oldest among everyone.

116
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,870
Where did she get that information?

117
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,780
Isn't it obvious? From Mom.

118
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,290
Mom is definitely closing in on us.

119
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,830
We have to hurry.

120
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,470
Think from the enemy's point of view.

121
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,140
Demons won't eat the tracking device.

122
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,150
That means it'd be in a placewhere it's easily remov—

123
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,480
Emma, I...

124
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,150
Where?

125
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,070
...want to ask you something.

126
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,900
That night...

127
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,370
{\an8}What's that? A bug bite?

128
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,580
{\an8}Mom told me a while ago that this wasfrom when blood was drawn to test for diseases.

129
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,840
{\an8}Naila, Phil, Mark, and Conny all had it.

130
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,800
{\an8}On everyone's ear...

131
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,970
{\an8}Mine too?

132
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,100
It's already gone.

133
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,480
Well, of course. I'm 10, and you're 11.

134
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,400
Yeah. It was way smaller than I thought.

135
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,690
What was?

136
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,530
Oh! I meant, it was such a small scarthat it had already disappeared.

137
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,490
Yeah.

138
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,130
I have to protect these kids.

139
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,140
Scheduled check-in. Scheduled check-in.

140
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,560
This is 73584, Plant Three.

141
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,390
October 17th. Everything is normal.

142
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,310
Now ending transmission.

143
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,690
{\i1}Isabella?{\i0}

144
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,770
Grandma!

145
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,440
{\i1}I have a message from the Boss.{\i0}

146
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,110
{\i1}"Those three can be shipped outas scheduled, right?"{\i0}

147
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,030
{\i1}Listen, Isabella.{\i0}

148
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,200
{\i1}This year, the other plantshave overall been bearing poor fruit.{\i0}

149
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:56,000
{\i1}Only your plant can deliver the supreme goodsthat will be offered at the Tifari.{\i0}

150
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,960
Yes, I've understood that from the beginning.

151
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,710
Please give the Boss this message.

152
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,590
"Everything is going fine.You may have any child at any time."

153
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,090
I see. So they can be shipped?

154
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,510
That would certainly please Him.

155
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,310
Don't mess this up. His meal is special,and nothing like ours.

156
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Then, my friends, let us celebrate the harvest.

157
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,070
And offer our prayers to Him.

158
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,010
Yeah, no one would notice this.

159
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,100
I never knew about a markfrom when they took our blood.

160
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,390
And it's somethingthat disappears so quickly?

161
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:00,190
Yeah. I didn't even suspect it at allthis whole time. I'm sorry.

162
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,610
No, you did well, Emma.

163
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,030
We now know the location, shape, and sizeof the tracking device.

164
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,490
We can move to the next step.

165
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,490
After locating it...

166
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,410
How to break it.

167
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,080
What do we do?If we cut it open to inspect it...

168
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,250
If Mom combs through our hair...

169
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,750
...she'll know immediately.

170
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,880
Yeah.

171
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,380
Well, putting aside to seeif we can break it easily or not,

172
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,920
the tracking device implanted in usisn't that functionally useful.

173
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,970
What? They aren't?

174
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,140
That's because the signalcan't specify the individual.

175
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,520
Without confirming, she can't tell where we are.

176
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,810
If we get close to the gate or walls,it doesn't notify her.

177
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,810
But it's still implanted.

178
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,480
Yeah. And why?

179
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,860
They must be confident they can come after usas long as the tracking device is intact.

180
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:53,410
Wait. Does that mean if it does notify them,it'd be when the tracking device is destroyed?

181
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,370
That's a possibility, too.

182
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,200
Meaning?

183
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:01,630
They would be notified only when it's broken,like with an alarm or something.

184
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,340
So if we destroy it,Mom will know immediately?

185
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,420
Well, if a notification function even exists.

186
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,340
But thinking that Mom purposely let us knowabout the existence of the tracking devices...

187
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,680
We can't dismiss it so easily.

188
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,180
It's risky to mess with it and break it.

189
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,690
So we can only destroy it when we escape.

190
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,360
Then how will we figure out how to break it?

191
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,240
Well, for that, this shape and sizebrings something to mind.

192
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,200
Can you leave this issue to me?

193
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,990
Are you sure?

194
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,870
Yeah.

195
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,370
If you're saying so, then I'll leave it to you.

196
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,120
The only thing leftis taking everyone outside with us.

197
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,340
The problem is that everyonecompletely trusts Mom,

198
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,960
and they probably won't be ableto handle the truth.

199
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,720
Do you think we'll have to lie to themto take them outside?

200
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,600
There's also the problem of insufficient abilities.

201
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,270
In simpler terms, they're a hindrance.

202
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,310
Ray!

203
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,850
But it's the truth.

204
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,520
Some aren't good at physical activities,

205
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,230
and we have babies who can hardly walk.

206
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,900
For that, I have an idea.

207
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,690
What is it?

208
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,110
Playing tag.

209
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,490
Norman is "It," and everyone runs away.

210
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,000
We pretend it's playwhen we're actually training.

211
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,250
That way, Mom won't find out.

212
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,750
I'll teach them how to utilize their bodies.

213
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,420
- As for how to utilize their brains...- Leave it to us.

214
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,390
Don't rush.

215
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,930
Think. What can you do to escape?

216
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,060
Norman won't overlook things like that.

217
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,780
Check the wind.

218
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,700
Which way makes it is easier to run away?

219
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,830
Let's see. Downwind.

220
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,640
This is cool.I can last a lot longer than before!

221
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,180
Maybe I can even make it—

222
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,430
I thought I was doing so good.

223
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,310
You can't just leave your own footprints.

224
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,190
You have to checkthe opponent's footprints, too.

225
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,270
Really?

226
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,280
Yeah. And Norman is also reading your habits.

227
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,530
For example, Thoma, you...

228
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,670
Playing tag looks like fun.

229
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,170
I want to get along with everyone.

230
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,920
So let's play tag.

231
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,800
The match's time limit will be 20 minutes.

232
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,550
I'll be "It."

233
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,470
Everyone, try to run away from me.

234
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,190
Seven, eight,

235
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,770
nine, ten!

236
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,940
Now, let me see what that woman'sspecial children can do!

237
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,240
So, how will the enemy move?

238
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,790
She'll probably look for us first.

239
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,040
And on the way,she'll capture as many little ones as she can.

240
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,540
Probably something like that.

241
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,220
Fake ones?

242
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,430
And what is with this silence?

243
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,350
I'll have to get serious!

244
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,900
She's not coming after us at all.

245
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,240
Did she change her strategy?

246
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
Huh?

247
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,000
Too bad, caught you!

248
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,460
Why did everyone gather in one spot?

249
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,920
She used these to lure in the younger ones.

250
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
So she's not stupid, huh?

251
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,970
No!

252
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,190
Listen everyone! Sister is really hard to beat!

253
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,700
Don and Gilda, too?

254
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,490
It was crazy. She chased me everywhere.

255
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,160
We got caught way fasterthan when Norman was "It."

256
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,000
Emma!

257
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,500
Cover your mouths!

258
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,680
Jump!

259
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:21,610
Running while carrying two kids.You must be tired, Emma.

260
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,620
You won't be able to move unless you rest.

261
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,910
Did you know?Norman's weakness is physical strength.

262
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,670
I heard he was feeble when he was younger.

263
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,130
Ray's weakness is thathe's a little quick to give up.

264
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,670
He makes a decision fastbut abandons them just as quickly.

265
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,880
And you, Emma!

266
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,260
Your weakness is your naiveté.

267
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,430
Like how naive you are by carrying otherswhen you're being chased.

268
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,980
Just give up and come on out.

269
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,230
I won't do you wrong.

270
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,530
Listen, Emma.If you saw the harvest that day...

271
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,320
then I'm on your side.

272
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,160
Found you!

273
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,500
Two more!

274
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,790
How much time is left?

275
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,920
Eight minutes and 40 seconds!

276
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,850
So these are the perfect scorers of this place.

277
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,900
Time's up.

278
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,320
- They did it!- Yay!

279
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,000
Norman. Ray. Emma.

280
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,420
And...

281
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,960
That sister hasn't done anything since.

282
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,930
That's probably Mom's order.

283
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,430
Mom used to suspect us,but it doesn't seem like that anymore.

284
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,890
I wonder why?

285
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,180
What do you think, Ray?

286
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,350
What about you, Norman?

287
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,570
Mom did something behind the scenesso she won't have to move herself.

288
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,820
What do you mean?

289
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,280
What do you think would bethe easiest situation for Mom?

290
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,330
That would be to know our moveswithout having to do anything.

291
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,000
But there are no security camerasor listening devices...

292
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,000
That means...

293
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,300
Yeah, there's probably...

294
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
...already a different person watching.

295
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,010
Most likely among the kids.

296
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,760
There's a traitor.

297
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,900
- I'm hungry!- Me too.
