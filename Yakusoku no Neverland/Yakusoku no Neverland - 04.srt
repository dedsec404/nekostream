1
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,250
So how has living here been?

2
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,130
Oh, this is a wonderful House.

3
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,510
All the children are smart and well-behaved.

4
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,760
I see. Lately you've been followinginstructions and being well-behaved as well.

5
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,560
Yes.

6
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,650
You try to get along with the children,and play tag with all your strength.

7
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,110
I was worried because you were a tomboy,but it looks like you're fine.

8
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,900
You are insurance.

9
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,530
Insurance that I called for, just in case,to make sure the products are protected.

10
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,370
So you don't need to knowwhich one knows the secret,

11
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,750
and just pretend to be obedient, work hard,

12
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,050
and laugh that you've graspedsome sort of weakness over me.

13
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,800
I wouldn't think of...

14
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,890
You have nothing else to dothan be my pawn, right?

15
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,140
If you behave...

16
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,190
I'll make sure that you become a Mom.

17
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,190
I promise.

18
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,030
You're a smart girl.

19
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,910
Don't make any more mistakes from now on.

20
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,200
That woman!

21
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,620
Just you watch!

22
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,620
I'll drag you down!

23
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,130
And then...

24
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,220
I will be Mom.

25
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,770
Emma.

26
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,900
Starting today, let's play tag in teams.

27
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,110
In teams?

28
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,480
At this rate, most of them would dieif they escaped individually.

29
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,820
Hey, Ray.

30
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,530
But everyone's movements aren't bad.

31
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,620
So we shouldn't break them up individually.

32
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,370
We'll make formations and run away in teams.

33
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,580
We'll play tag in a way that's similarto what the real escape would be like.

34
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,620
The real escape.

35
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,750
And I have another idea.

36
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,500
Let's tell Don and Gilda.

37
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,340
We'll explain the situationand have them lead the teams.

38
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,720
What if they're Mom's informant?

39
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,600
No worries. Finding out who the informant is,and also winning them over.

40
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,220
I can do them simultaneously.

41
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,060
And I've already made arrangements.

42
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,190
Emma.

43
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,690
For now, I'll tell you 100 typesof formation patterns, so memorize them.

44
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,690
You mean by ear?

45
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,280
You can't do it?

46
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,200
Easy peasy!

47
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,450
- I won't get caught this time!- Good luck.

48
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,460
Okay, try not to get caught for 10 minutes.

49
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,080
Start.

50
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,550
Everyone, follow me!

51
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,260
Let's succeed and surprise Ray!

52
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,930
Let's do this!

53
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,600
That was fun!

54
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,930
Phil, you were good at running away.

55
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,980
This is really fun!

56
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,850
I want to be leader for the next one!

57
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,440
But let's take a break for a little bit.

58
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,190
It looks like playing tagin teams is going to work!

59
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,950
What was Phil's score again?

60
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,330
Let's see.

61
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,290
He's averaging about 203 lately.

62
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,460
That's high.

63
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:51,710
He was one of the last ones remaining this timeand also when we played tag with Sister.

64
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,430
He's always looking for you and Normanwith Sherry, too.

65
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,520
Stop it!I don't want to suspect anyone after all!

66
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,570
Idiot. Even if you don't want to,you need to be more suspicious! Thoroughly!

67
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,940
This is life or death.

68
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,370
Ray.

69
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,790
Any progress on howto break the tracking devices?

70
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,840
How long do you need until you're prepared?

71
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,670
Let's see.

72
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,880
Ten days.

73
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,420
Then let's commence the planten days from now.

74
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,640
We'll carry out the escape planten days from now, on November 8th.

75
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,390
W-Wait!

76
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,600
Isn't it too soon? I mean, it's fine, but...

77
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,060
It's not fine!

78
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,190
It's been two weeks since Conny was shipped.

79
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,690
The shipment cycle is at least two months,so we should have about a month and a half.

80
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,360
I thought the plan was to carefully prepareduring that time!

81
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,160
Yeah. Just as you thought that way,Mom's controlling us to think that way, too.

82
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,370
So we need to outwit that.

83
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,920
And if we fail from being too rushed?Then what?

84
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,840
Either way, we need to escapebefore winter comes.

85
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,090
As soon as we break the tracking devices,let's execute our escape plan as quickly as possible.

86
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,590
That means we have to do what's necessaryin the remaining ten days.

87
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,180
Let's talk to Don and Gilda tonight.

88
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,450
Both of you, follow my lead.

89
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,500
What did you want to talk about?

90
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,840
What?

91
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,210
Human trafficking?

92
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,430
Yeah. All of our siblingshave been sold off to bad people.

93
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,190
There's no way! No way!

94
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:01,070
But the walls, the gate, and the siblingswho left and never write us letters...

95
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,610
Oh come on, now.

96
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,280
So what's the punch line?What kind of prank is this?

97
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,210
You're not saying it's true, are you?

98
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,840
It's true.

99
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,510
Wait. Then what about Mom?

100
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,760
She's the one...

101
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,680
who's selling us to bad people.

102
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,180
There's no way that kind Momwould do such a thing!

103
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,970
Take it back, Emma!

104
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,310
Don.

105
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,400
Emma loves this House and Mom.

106
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,860
So there's no way she would lie about that.

107
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,400
Gilda.

108
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,700
And I did think it was weird.

109
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,200
The night Conny left...

110
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,620
Emma and Norman went to the gate, and...

111
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,830
You did?

112
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,250
Even if you broke the rules,

113
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,050
both of you would usually apologize immediately,and everything would be back to normal.

114
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,680
But you haven't done that.

115
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,430
Emma, you've become so serious now.

116
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,100
So I couldn't ask about it.

117
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,110
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gilda.

118
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,780
I made you worry.

119
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,160
Did you see it, Emma?

120
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,240
Conny being sold off...

121
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,370
to those bad people.

122
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,370
Yeah.

123
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,670
But we didn't make it in time.

124
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,090
Conny is safe, right?

125
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,300
I don't know.

126
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,260
But how...

127
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,470
How could this even happen?

128
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,850
I don't know if this proves anything,

129
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,600
but these are our siblings' scores that I hadRay and Emma look into for the past few days.

130
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,690
Scores?

131
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,070
The ones who left are over six years oldand adopted in the order of lowest scores first.

132
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,450
Isn't that weird?

133
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,160
True, Conny's scores are...

134
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,820
And Hao and Sadie...

135
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,450
You're right, Norman.

136
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,290
Don. Gilda.

137
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,040
Let's escape from hereand go help Conny and the others.

138
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,790
Let's all run away from here, together!

139
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,630
Please help us.

140
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,610
Hey, Norman.

141
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,110
Is this about the shipment?

142
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,940
What do you mean you "don't know"?

143
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,030
You should have said they died!

144
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,160
That was the best wayto smoothly get them to help us.

145
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,740
If they weren't the spies after all...

146
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,080
then this kind of lie is too cruel.

147
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,540
"They're alive"?Don't give them hope that doesn't exist.

148
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,380
How and when are you goingto tell them the truth?

149
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,710
Can you tell them?

150
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,050
I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

151
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,640
We're still assuming they might be the spies, too.So I'm going to lay a trap.

152
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,850
A trap?

153
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,060
I'll tell both of them where the rope is hidden.

154
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,520
I'll tell Don it's under my bed.

155
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,770
To Gilda, I'll tell her it's in the ceilingof the second floor bathroom.

156
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,530
Who will make a move?How will Mom find out? We can trace it from there.

157
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:37,120
And the ropes? If they weren't the spies,and there's nothing there, it'll get complicated.

158
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,120
I have something else for that, too.

159
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,630
So you're completely prepared, huh?

160
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,790
I told you.

161
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,880
We have to outwit her.

162
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,340
Come back here!

163
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,010
It's been a while since we talked like this.

164
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,520
It's weird, right?Even though we're together every day.

165
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,900
And we'll be together from now on, too, right?

166
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,360
Yeah.

167
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,970
I see.

168
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,850
The rope is hidden in Norman's bed.

169
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,450
I've been waiting for you, Gilda.

170
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,180
Now, please talk to me, Gilda.

171
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,100
About that issue, right?

172
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,570
There isn't anything I'm worried about.

173
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,780
I appreciate that you frequentlychecked on me out of concern.

174
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,290
That's right, I'm worried.

175
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,370
But I'm okay now.

176
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,580
So you can leave me alone.

177
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,960
Please excuse me.

178
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,920
I see. Emma told you everything, then?

179
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,310
Gilda, so you know abouteverything now, don't you?

180
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,190
Darn, it's too bad, Gilda.

181
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,240
I thought we could become friends.

182
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,120
So who else knows?

183
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,160
Norman. Ray. And?

184
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:14,090
I'll let only you go,so why don't we join hands?

185
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,560
Please stop!

186
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,690
I don't know what you're talking about!

187
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,650
I just had a fight with Emma.But we made up, so everything's okay now!

188
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,780
I see. So it was my misunderstanding.I apologize.

189
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:50,000
If you think Emma has lied to you,come back to me.

190
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,500
I'll see you later, Gilda.

191
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,600
Emma.

192
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,640
Gilda.

193
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,740
I'm not giving up.

194
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,740
If I can't get Gilda...

195
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,490
The great Thoma has arrived!

196
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,460
I wonder if it's okay?

197
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,290
Let's go. Mom's watching.

198
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,430
According to what Emma told me,Gilda is innocent.

199
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,220
Hey, Ray. I wonder whytraitors betray others.

200
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,890
Maybe it's because there must besome merit in doing so.

201
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,980
For example, they can be spared frombeing shipped out and can become an adult.

202
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,570
A guarantee to live, huh?

203
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,750
I see, so this was training for running away.

204
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,040
One, two...

205
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,460
Three...

206
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,380
Emma.

207
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,590
Can I talk to you?

208
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,800
I'd like to hear your opinion.

209
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,930
What if there's someone who is willinglybeing an agent of the demons,

210
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,230
and that by spying on us,they are guaranteed to continue living...

211
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,610
You mean, in exchange for spying on us,they won't get shipped out and can live?

212
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,440
Would you leave that person behind?Or take them with us?

213
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,200
I'd take them with us.

214
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,990
Even if that person didn't want that?

215
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,700
Yeah. I'd force them to come with us.

216
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,880
Because if we escape, that person's lifemight not be guaranteed anymore.

217
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,420
Also, I want to believe, after all.

218
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,130
The incident with Gilda made me realize that.

219
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,970
Ray told me to suspect everyone, but evenif there's a traitor who is a demon's agent,

220
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,430
no one within our siblings is a bad person.

221
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,390
We're family that grew up together.

222
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,980
Even if that person gets in the way,betrays us, or says I'm naïve,

223
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,900
I want to believe in that person!

224
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,820
Of course you would say that, Emma.

225
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,980
So?

226
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,770
Nothing.

227
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,070
Seriously?

228
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,280
Then it's confirmed that it's Don.

229
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,780
Yeah.

230
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,200
So you're the traitor, Ray.
