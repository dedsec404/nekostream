1
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,480
What is this?

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,360
It's a gate. It connects the inside and outside.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,990
Outside, huh?

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,280
We've never been outside.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,870
That's because we've been here\Never since we were born.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,420
Mom always tells us, doesn't she?

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,710
"Don't go near the gate or fence in the back\Nof the forest because it's dangerous."

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,510
That's obviously a lie.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,050
Really?

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,130
Hey, Ray!

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,220
What do you want to do if you go outside?

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,430
I don't know. What about you?

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,010
I want to ride a giraffe!

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,600
Good luck.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,230
I wonder...

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,520
I wonder what this gate is protecting us from.

17
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,680
Everyone, wake up!

18
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,980
Or you'll be late for breakfast!

19
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,860
- Hey, wait for me!\N- No way!

20
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,820
Hey! Stop messing around and get ready!

21
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,280
- Emma, I can't get my shoes on.\N- I can't tie my shoelaces!

22
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,030
Okay, hold on. Don't cry.

23
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,750
Good morning Don, Conny, and Little Bunny!

24
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,290
- Morning!\N- Morning, Emma.

25
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,260
Look, we made it!

26
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,600
Watch out...

27
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,850
I'm going to eat you!

28
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,230
They're at it again.

29
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,070
Morning, Norman! And Ray!

30
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,400
Good morning, Emma.

31
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,320
Morning, Emma.

32
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,370
You're so energetic.\NEven though you haven't eaten breakfast yet.

33
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,160
How old are you again? Five?

34
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,410
I'm 11, the same as you guys!

35
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,330
And one of the oldest here!

36
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,460
You're laughing, too, Mom?

37
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,460
Emma, can you give me a hand over here?

38
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,050
But Mom! I'm going to redo my entrance\Nfrom the beginning.

39
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,850
Why? I love that part about you.

40
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,850
That I'm five years old on the inside?

41
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,020
The part where you care deeply\Nabout your family.

42
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,690
Thanks, Mom!

43
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,410
Good morning, my dear children.

44
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,620
Let's give thanks that all 38 of you siblings\Nare able to live here happily, today, too...

45
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,670
Thank you for the food.

46
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,790
Thank you for the food.

47
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,550
Here. Open wide.

48
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,890
It's delicious!

49
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,480
You're acting like a little baby, Conny.

50
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,100
I can, right, especially today?

51
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,150
Yes.

52
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,610
{\i1}Age 11, type 1.{\i0}

53
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,610
{\i1}Answer each question within nine seconds.{\i0}

54
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,950
{\i1}We will now begin.{\i0}

55
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,470
Well, I think I got at least half!

56
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,730
That much? Wow!

57
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,940
I'm jealous. I didn't get most of it.

58
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,570
Are you all ready for the results?

59
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,690
Norman. Ray. Emma.

60
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,660
You three did an amazing job.\NYou got all of them right! Perfect scores!

61
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,160
Those three are different, huh?

62
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,160
Norman is a genius who has the best brains.

63
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,170
And Ray, an intellect\Nwho can compete against Norman's genius.

64
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,840
Emma has amazing athletic skills, and her learning\Nability allows her to stay close to the other two.

65
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,890
They say the House has never had three kids\Nat this level together before.

66
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,800
No wonder Mom is happy with them.

67
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,350
Norman!

68
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,980
I challenge you to a game of tag!

69
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,600
Run, run!

70
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,430
Come get me, Norman!\NWe'll outrun you this time for sure!

71
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,800
Right, Conny?

72
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,890
Thank you for always helping me, Don.

73
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,440
You don't have to thank me!

74
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,940
I'll always help you!\NAnytime, anywhere you're in need!

75
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,110
Based on the size of these shoe's footsteps...

76
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,200
You let your guard down, Norman!

77
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,250
Don, you always let your guard down.

78
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,880
Don't I always tell you? Your weakness is that\Nyou make quick judgment and lose your cool.

79
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,550
Dang, I got caught.

80
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,300
What the heck? He practically got everyone.

81
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,010
Well, it's Norman after all.

82
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,390
The only survivor is...

83
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,560
...just Emma.

84
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,150
Norman!

85
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,400
I was pretending.

86
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,780
No fair! I was worried about you!

87
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,450
Emma, your weakness is that you're nice.

88
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,450
He caught me again! Why?\NSo frustrating!

89
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,620
Question.

90
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,330
What does Norman have that you don't?

91
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,550
The ability to plan ahead? Calmness?\NOverwhelming intelligence?

92
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,970
Strategy.

93
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,010
If it's about simple physical ability,\Nyou have the upper hand.

94
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,140
But Norman is strong right here. Like no other.

95
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,770
You're playing tag.\NIt's a game where you compete with strategy.

96
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,860
A simple game of tag?

97
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,530
It's like chess, but using your entire body.

98
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,280
Isn't that right, Norman?

99
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,620
Yeah. But you're a better tactician than me, Ray.

100
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,910
You overestimate me.

101
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,580
Reading the enemy's moves, huh?

102
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,000
But we're not even close\Nwhen it comes to Mom.

103
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,040
That's true. We've never beaten her at chess.

104
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,920
Norman!

105
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,220
I want a rematch!\NNext game, everyone will be "It" except you!

106
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,800
- Whoa!\N- He's losing his cool again.

107
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,990
You caught me.

108
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,870
"You can't go near there, no matter what."

109
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,080
Yeah, Mom is always telling us that.

110
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,710
The gate and the fence deep in the forest\Nare dangerous.

111
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,340
That's obviously a lie.

112
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,750
What do you mean?

113
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,210
Well, just look at it.

114
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
What part of this is dangerous?

115
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,220
The fence is low,\Nand I don't see anything threatening.

116
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,720
But if Mom is telling us that...

117
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,020
You really love Mom, after all.

118
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,980
But everyoneâ€”

119
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,020
Hey! Are you sure you guys are playing tag?

120
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,400
Oh, is the game over already?

121
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,990
We should call it a day.\NIf we're late, Mom will be worried.

122
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,780
We'll eventually leave this place, huh?

123
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,990
This is an orphanage.\NOf course we'll leave eventually.

124
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,160
Before we turn 12.

125
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,000
You know what?

126
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,880
We don't receive letters from anyone.

127
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,750
Letters?

128
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,130
You know, after they leave the House,\Nno one writes us.

129
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,970
I'm sure they're being considerate\Nto their foster parents.

130
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,310
But we've all been together\Never since we were born!

131
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,810
Even if we're not related by blood,\Nwe're truer siblings than most.

132
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,440
They must be having so much fun everyday\Nthat they've forgotten about the House.

133
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,650
Then it's fine, right? I'm happy for them.

134
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,660
I want to go outside, too!

135
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,990
What would you do outside?

136
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,530
Isn't it obvious? Get new clothes!

137
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,490
- Not again.\N- I mean, come on!

138
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,700
We only have this one uniform!

139
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:21,790
I read in books that the outside world has so many\Ndifferent types of clothes! I want to wear them all!

140
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,920
I want to eat delicious food.

141
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,050
I want to go on a date with a cute girl.

142
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,300
Geez, that was rude.

143
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,430
Oh, that's not what I meant.

144
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,300
I want to see a train!

145
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,140
That's a good one!

146
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,350
What about you, Norman?

147
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,560
I want to go to different places\Nand see things I've never seen before.

148
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,360
Good idea! And you, Ray?

149
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,950
Once I get outside, well, I'd have to survive first.

150
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,950
Such a downer. What about you, Emma?

151
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,200
Me?

152
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,080
You want to ride a giraffe, right?

153
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,740
Did I say that?

154
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,750
Well, I don't really want to leave.\NI want to stay here forever!

155
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,080
Hey, that's kind of unfair.

156
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,000
But I'm so happy right now. Right?

157
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,510
Happy, huh?

158
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,510
I promise to write!

159
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,010
I'll write a lot of letters.\NI'll never forget about everyone.

160
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,890
When I leave the House,\NI want to become a mother like Mom.

161
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,020
And then, I'll never abandon any children.

162
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,150
You love Mom very much, don't you?

163
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,480
Yeah!

164
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm slow, and I wasn't as smart as everyone,\Nbut even after I leave, I'll do my best.

165
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,180
I'll have Little Bunny so I'll be okay.

166
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,600
Conny...

167
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,230
I don't want to leave anymore.\NI want to stay here!

168
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,520
Conny... Conny!

169
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,370
What song is that, Mom?

170
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,310
Conny!

171
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,060
You're kidding me!

172
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,320
Let's hurry and finish up cleaning.

173
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,190
Conny's already gone!

174
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,360
What should I do?

175
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,610
There's still time.

176
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,370
From the window,\NI saw the lights on the gate were still on.

177
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,450
Mom isn't back yet either,\Nso I don't think Conny has left yet.

178
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,420
- Let's hurry, Emma.\N- Okay.

179
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,470
"You can't go near there, no matter what."

180
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,720
I know. Let's get scolded together, later.

181
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,270
Conny?

182
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,720
Is this the truck that'll take Conny?

183
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,010
Actually, I've never seen a vehicle before.

184
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,870
No one's here.

185
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,580
Maybe she'll find it if we leave it in the back.

186
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,750
Yeah.

187
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,050
Norman.

188
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,710
Is someone there?

189
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,630
Hey, did you hear a voice just now?

190
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,340
Probably your imagination.

191
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,350
If it was a stray cat,\NI would have caught it and ate it.

192
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,810
You eat things like cats?

193
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,250
It looks so delicious. Human flesh is the best.

194
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,010
No...

195
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,350
Damn! Can't I at least have a fingertip?

196
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,930
You idiot. It's valuable merchandise.

197
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,980
It's not something the likes of us can have.

198
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,690
All of the human flesh produced on this farm\Nare high-quality meat intended for the rich.

199
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:17,780
Where's Mom?

200
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,610
Is the Gupna done?

201
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,320
Mostly done, sir.

202
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,490
Another six-year-old...

203
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,870
Lately we've been shipping out\Nnormal quality ones.

204
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,750
But it looks like we'll soon harvest\Nsome high quality ones.

205
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,130
Isabella.

206
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,130
Yes.

207
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,510
Make the preparations\Nto pluck these three with full scores.

208
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,800
Understood.

209
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,050
Wait. I smell something.

210
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,570
Emma!

211
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,250
Is this place a farm?

212
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,460
Are we all... food?

213
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:23,510
No, it can't be. Everyone found foster homes.

214
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,090
And Mom...\NIt was the usual, kind Mom, right?

215
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,850
We were mistaken.\NThat girl wasn't Conny, right?

216
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,610
That was Conny.

217
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,330
Welcome back. How did it go?

218
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,170
We didn't make it.

219
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,890
Were we raised just to be eaten by something?

220
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,640
Let's escape, Emma.\NWe have to leave this place.

221
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,230
Don't worry. We can do it.

222
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
You, me, and Ray. If it's the three of us...

223
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,270
It might be impossible.

224
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,450
I can't leave them here.\NOtherwise they'll definitely get killed.

225
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,530
I don't want any more of my family to die.

226
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,960
It's not impossible.

227
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,930
It'll be okay. Let's run away.\NTogether, with everyone.

228
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,470
B-But how? How will us kids\Nrun away from those monsters?

229
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,570
Strategy. It'll be the same as playing tag.

230
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,570
That's right.\NWe'll find a way for all of us to survive.
