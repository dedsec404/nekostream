1
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,450
Phil?

2
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,160
I'm playing hide-and-seekwith Naila and Eugene.

3
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,080
I see.

4
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,500
So...

5
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,010
What we need to investigate now is...

6
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,260
Outside.

7
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,180
We know most of what we need toabout the House.

8
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,310
The training is going well.The tracking devices can be broken.

9
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,010
We just need...

10
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,020
...to get intel on the outside,and if we can outmaneuver the adults here,

11
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,480
we can definitely clear the wall.

12
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,520
Next is checking out an escape route.

13
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,780
So this escape has three steps.

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,860
One, get over the wall and escape.

15
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,490
Two, get away from this farm safely.

16
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,450
Three, establish a way to survive outsideand become self-reliant.

17
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,750
Currently, we have hopeof accomplishing the first step.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,670
Next is the second step.We need to focus on the outside.

19
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,710
Evade the pursuersand get away from the farm safely.

20
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,180
We need to examine and prepare for that.

21
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,550
First, we need informationabout the area around the farm.

22
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,810
Oh, when I climbed up the tree,I saw a forest beyond the wall.

23
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,520
Those are the thingswe need to properly check.

24
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,520
We should look into it as soon as tomorrow.

25
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,190
Okay.

26
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,650
Hey, can I talk about another thinghaving to do with when we get outside?

27
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,690
I have someone I want to introduce.

28
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,870
Sorry, Mom. I'm in a rush!

29
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,660
Mom, look!

30
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,580
I did it.

31
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,760
Amazing, right?

32
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,850
The person I want to introduce is...

33
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,060
this person.

34
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,560
Mr. William Minerva?

35
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Yep.

36
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,020
Who's he?

37
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,230
I don't know. What I do know is thathe's the previous owner of that book.

38
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,990
But he could be someone who's on our side.

39
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,410
What do you mean?

40
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,120
This person has been conveyinga certain message through books.

41
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,660
And not just one book.

42
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
Through many of them!

43
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,970
This symbol is...

44
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,090
A bookplate.

45
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,390
A label that indicates the book's ownerbefore it came here.

46
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,470
And what's that certain message?

47
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,640
Look carefully.

48
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,810
They all look like the same owl.

49
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,730
No.

50
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,820
This circle...

51
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,240
Morse code!

52
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,990
Correct.

53
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,610
Run.

54
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,610
Doubt.

55
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,990
Danger.

56
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,990
Truth.

57
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,330
But with just this...

58
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,870
What about these?

59
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,830
Harvest.

60
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,670
Monster.

61
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,380
Farm.

62
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,840
Farm.

63
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,340
This is a message from the outside to us,hidden from the demons and the adults.

64
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,510
I think we can at least trust that.

65
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,720
Trust that?

66
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,520
Unlike her, I'm more suspicious.

67
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,940
This man named Minerva could be an ally to us.

68
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,650
But we don't know if he's dead or alive.

69
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,990
We shouldn't get our hopes up too much.

70
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,820
Why are you always like that?

71
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:57,580
William Minerva. This man is outsideand knows our farm exists.

72
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,410
And though indirectly, he's trying to help us.

73
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,540
Yes!

74
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,920
There was an ally on the outside.And he might still be there.

75
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,050
If that's true, then there could bea society of humans outside.

76
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,170
Exactly!

77
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,620
These kinds of messagescan only be found in Minerva's books.

78
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,160
I don't know whenthese labels were attached,

79
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,580
but I at least know this onewas attached after the year 2015.

80
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,210
I see.

81
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,460
Is there anything else we could know?

82
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,340
Like something in common betweenthe contents or the type of books?

83
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,840
Not much.

84
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,890
The genres are varied.The publishers and the years were—

85
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,720
But what about that thing?Uh, which one was it?

86
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,560
I didn't understand the Morse codeon these two books.

87
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,020
For the content,one is a typical adventure novel,

88
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,230
and a mythology bookthat I didn't really understand.

89
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,190
There's no Morse code on this.

90
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,860
And the other one is...

91
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,360
Promise.

92
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,830
Promise?

93
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,250
Why is this here?

94
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,290
So it was true, what they said.

95
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,550
Mom was lying.No one was sent to foster families.

96
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,710
But why...

97
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,590
Because if they were,there's no way this would be here.

98
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,890
It would have been delivered to Conny.

99
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,890
It's not just Little Bunny.

100
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,310
They were all snatched away from themby Mom when they left,

101
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,270
and they were all taken away by bad people.

102
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,730
Stop it.

103
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,570
I think these have a meaning.

104
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,250
Like how one book doesn't have the Morse code,and there were others with ripped pages.

105
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,410
And the message of "promise."

106
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,790
So you think these two books are special?

107
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
Yeah. I feel like...

108
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,340
these will become some kind ofan important guide for us.

109
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
What's your reasoning?

110
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,340
My hunch!

111
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,850
Don't give me that look!

112
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,100
Who is Mom communicating with?

113
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,940
The base Ray was talking about?

114
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,110
Are they the bad people?

115
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,570
That's right, he said he had Mom under control,but we're doomed if Sister finds out.

116
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,490
What did he mean by doomed?

117
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,530
If they find out, is Mom or Sistergoing to do something to us?

118
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,370
What if Mom is much more dangerous,and Conny and our siblings are already...

119
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,040
Stop it. Norman said he doesn't knowwhat happened to Conny.

120
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,840
No. They're just hiding it from us.

121
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,260
They probably have a reason and can't tell us.

122
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,550
I can't believe them like that.

123
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,810
Because they don't believe in us.

124
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,140
But I think it's worth looking into.

125
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,440
Mr. Minerva and the mystery of his books.

126
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,650
We're not just running away.Let's find a way for us to survive in this world.

127
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,150
Yeah. Let's run away.

128
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,150
Let's live.

129
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,660
No matter what the world is like.

130
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,750
Hold on, Phil. I'll be there in a moment.

131
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,000
But I'm surprised.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,880
It's expected from Raywho reads books all the time, but...

133
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,550
For Emma to notice those bookplates...

134
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,430
I wasn't the one who noticed them.

135
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,810
Phil found them and told me.

136
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,720
Phil?

137
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,480
Yeah. He was reading a children’s bookand it was one of Mr. Minerva's.

138
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,230
It was a book that had Morse code in the story.

139
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,820
Can you get the plates?

140
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,070
Thanks.

141
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,490
Where are Don and Gilda?

142
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,990
They're not here either.

143
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,950
They can't be...

144
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,900
Mom!

145
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,410
Oh. What’s wrong, Eugene?

146
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,240
I found this on the floor.

147
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,290
Thank you.

148
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,590
I'm hungry.

149
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,510
Don. Gilda.

150
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,010
Thank goodness, I thought you'd...

151
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,560
Where were you?

152
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,030
So?

153
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,150
We went in to Mom's secret room.

154
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,320
How?

155
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,990
Don stole the key.

156
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,030
From Mom?

157
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,870
And, did Mom...

158
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,420
I don't think she noticed. We alreadyreturned the key, too. So probably...

159
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,130
You did something really stupid.

160
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,220
What would you do if the room was equippedwith either a camera, a bug, or an alarm?

161
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,350
If Mom or Sister found out,you two... no, all of us would be—

162
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,140
Tell us what would happen.

163
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,270
Would we get killed?

164
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,860
We found Conny's Little Bunnyin the secret room.

165
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,400
So much for your "I don't know"and "let's go save them".

166
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,990
We can't even go save them, right?

167
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,030
Because Conny...

168
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,570
Conny and everyone else is...

169
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,280
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,660
I'm really sorry!

171
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,660
So they're really...

172
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,410
I told you, Gilda.

173
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,040
They were lying after all.

174
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,420
What are you hiding? Tell us the whole truth.

175
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,190
Demons? A farm?

176
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,860
No. Just to be eaten...

177
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,740
And you're a spy? This whole time?

178
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,160
It was for our sake.

179
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,240
Then Ray, you knew what was goingto happen to Conny that day?

180
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:01,460
Emma and Norman, you both tried to trick usand take us out into a world full of enemies?

181
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,810
You're kidding me!

182
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,060
Hey, Don!

183
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,360
Don.

184
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,740
Are we that much of a burden?

185
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:40,040
Are we that weak and useless to youthat you feel the need to protect us?

186
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,000
That time, when you asked us to help you,I thought you were relying on us.

187
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,800
Was that a lie?

188
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,720
We're not as smart as you three.

189
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,640
We're not, but still...

190
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,430
...aren't we family?

191
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,520
Aren't we siblings?

192
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,060
I just want you to have a little faith in us!

193
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,070
Sorry, I'm acting a little weird right now.I'm going to go cool off.

194
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,650
Don.

195
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,880
I was wrong.

196
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,590
That's not it.

197
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,180
I'm just taking it out on them.

198
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,680
I'm not frustrated becausethey treated us like weaklings.

199
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,060
I made them lie.

200
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,770
I couldn't do anythingfor Conny and the others.

201
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,020
I'm ignorant and powerless.

202
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,030
It's frustrating because I really am a weakling.

203
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,530
It's so frustrating!

204
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,870
I want to become stronger.

205
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,120
I want to become stronger.

206
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,500
Yeah.

207
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
Don! Gilda!

208
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,460
Emma.

209
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,720
Sorry. I didn't understand.

210
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,060
I was prepared to be resented, but I didn'thave enough resolve to believe in you!

211
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,020
I'm also...

212
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,190
Sorry.

213
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,780
No, well, I'm also sorrythat I suddenly punched you.

214
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,530
Are you okay? You're not, huh?

215
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,780
I'll be okay.

216
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm sorry, too, about acting on our own.

217
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,410
Yeah. Of course Ray would get mad.

218
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,870
So we're really...

219
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,960
Come on, Ray.

220
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,010
Geez, fine.

221
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,680
Even if the worst happens,I'll take care of it somehow.

222
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,810
I'm also sorry for the other things I did.I apologize.

223
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,150
Don. Gilda. There's no more lying,so let me ask again.

224
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,730
If we mess up, we die.

225
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,280
The outside is, at worst, a world full of demons.

226
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,660
Even so, will you run away with us?

227
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,540
Of course we will!

228
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,680
I feel better now that we told them the truth.

229
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,260
Yeah.

230
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,060
One week until we carry out our plan.The preparations are going well, too.

231
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,650
We just have to figure outhow to escape with everyone.

232
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,770
Hey, Norman, about that...

233
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,780
I tried to figure out on my ownhow to escape with everyone.

234
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,540
Do you think it's reckless?

235
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,710
It is.

236
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,750
But with this plan,we can catch Mom off guard.

237
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,960
Realistically, this is the only wayto escape with everyone.

238
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,970
Yeah.

239
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,470
Should we tell Ray?

240
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,680
No.

241
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,430
Do you think Raywould really have everyone escape?

242
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,770
Of course he would.

243
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,650
Ray's been moving all this timewhile thinking about us.

244
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,570
Always, for the both of us.

245
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,650
Both of us?

246
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:42,280
Oh. Don't worry.I'll bring it up to Ray sometime soon.

247
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,490
Okay.

248
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,900
"All this to make sureyou two don't get killed."

249
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,980
I see. You're amazing, Ray.

250
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,700
I stole them, just like you wanted.

251
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,780
Detergent and herbicide.

252
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,950
What are you going to use these for?

253
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,910
They'll come in handy for our investigation.

254
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,920
By investigation, you mean we'll go past the fenceto climb the wall and look outside, right?

255
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,340
What about the tracking devices?

256
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,420
We just have to make surethey don't check them.

257
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,930
We'll have both Mom and Sisterlooking somewhere else,

258
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,140
and create a situation where theywon't look at their trackers.

259
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,720
But how?

260
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,180
I'll have Ray stall Mom.

261
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,230
I'm having him give her false information.

262
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,900
So you had a fight with that Norman?

263
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,070
We had a difference of opinion.

264
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,570
So what did you want to tell me?

265
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,950
Norman is trying to kill you.

266
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,450
If he wants to escape with everyone,that's something he would think of.

267
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,460
And?

268
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,120
He's collecting items.

269
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,590
A hammer, detergent, herbicide,or anything else that he thinks he can use.

270
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,210
Including that rope that's too short?

271
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,720
Yeah. I tried to stop him, you know.

272
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,800
I told him it's too risky and wrong.

273
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,680
And that's how you got that bruise.

274
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,060
Murder by poison.Chemicals can be troublesome.

275
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,190
Yeah. You'd better not ship them out early.

276
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,980
I want them to live to the end,until 12 years old.

277
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,230
In this House, without any discomforts.

278
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,570
So let's replace the chemicalswith something else.

279
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,030
Put fake stuff in the containers.

280
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,570
Do you know where it is?

281
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,450
- Yeah.- Then let's deal with this tomorrow.

282
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,870
Is that all you have to report?

283
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,870
Yeah. Do you have something elsethat's bothering you?

284
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,960
Not at all.

285
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Oh, right.

286
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,090
I'm letting you know a little early.

287
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,050
I received a notification from the topat yesterday's scheduled check-in.

288
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,630
The next shipment has been set.

289
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,510
There will be no regular shipmentfor next month.

290
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,310
Then the next one will be in January.

291
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,890
My 12th birthday.

292
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,570
So the next shipment will finally be me, huh?

293
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,740
But even if we leave Ray to deal with Mom,what about Sister?

294
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,580
Yeah, if she finds out,we'll be shipped out immediately, right?

295
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,450
Don't worry, I have an idea.

296
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,970
Do you need something?

297
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,560
I saw it.

298
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,020
I was watching the whole thing!

299
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,150
Talking in the dining hall last night,all of you!

300
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,150
The ones who know the secretabout this House

301
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:10,660
is Norman, Emma, Ray, Gilda, and Don.The five of you.

302
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,500
So...

303
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,790
would you like to join forces?
