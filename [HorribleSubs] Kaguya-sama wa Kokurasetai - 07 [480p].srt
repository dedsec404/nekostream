1
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,480
Relationship advice, huh?

2
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,450
Yes! Right now,\NI'm facing a major problem!

3
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,080
{\an3}MIYUKI SHIROGANE\NWANTS TO WORK

4
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,080
{\an8}I thought only you, the Love Master,\Nwould be able to solve this issue!

5
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,460
The ship has already sailed!

6
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,500
I'll see your voyage through to the end!

7
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
President!

8
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,130
{\i1}Here we go again.{\i0}

9
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,510
{\i1}I'm at the end of my rope\Nfor this charade!{\i0}

10
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,760
{\an8}{\i1}How could I ever be thought of\Nas the Love Master?{\i0}

11
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,800
{\an8}{\i1}How did I qualify for that title?{\i0}

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,510
{\an8}{\i1}If a virgin can qualify,\NI'll get it sooner or later!{\i0}

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,020
{\i1}The idea of me giving\Ngirlfriend advice is ridiculous!{\i0}

14
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,270
{\i1}Please, make this an easy one!{\i0}

15
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,900
{\an8}{\i1}That's Miss Kashiwagi's boyfriend.{\i0}

16
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,780
{\an8}{\i1}I thought things were going well with them\Ndoing the charity work together.{\i0}

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,610
So, what's the problem?

18
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,280
Right. Actually...

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,030
I want to hold\NMiss Kashiwagi's hand!

20
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,030
{\an8}BLURT

21
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:33,420
{\an8}We've been dating for a month now,\Nso I'd like to do something romantic.

22
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,920
{\an8}That's why I want your advice\Non what I should do to hold hands with her!

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,180
{\i1}Why don't you ask a friend for advice?{\i0}

24
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,840
{\i1}Isn't this just bragging?{\i0}

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,430
{\i1}Did he come to brag,\Npretending he wants advice?{\i0}

26
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,230
{\i1}The president has a big heart,\Nbut I'm sure even he'll get mad at—{\i0}

27
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,560
{\an8}Oh, that.

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,440
{\an8}OH-THAT-ISM

29
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,440
{\i1}The face of a Buddha?{\i0}

30
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,400
{\i1}He brought up something normal.{\i0}

31
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,860
{\i1}Even I can advise about holding hands.\NI can handle the ABCs of love.{\i0}

32
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,580
{\i1}The ABCs of love!{\i0}

33
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,040
{\i1}Of the many kinds of couples,{\i0}

34
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,080
{\i1}the meaning between them differs\Ndepending upon the depth of the relationship.{\i0}

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,420
{\i1}The ABCs are one barometer\Nto measure that depth.{\i0}

36
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,880
{\i1}A is kissing. B is petting.{\i0}

37
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,630
{\i1}C indicates a relationship\Nthat has gone all the way.{\i0}

38
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,050
{\an8}{\i1}This boyfriend is a beginner who decided\Nto begin climbing the ABC mountain.{\i0}

39
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,930
{\an8}{\i1}The stage he is at differs little\Nfrom fellow virgin, Shirogane.{\i0}

40
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,850
Listen. Holding hands is simple.

41
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,270
Rent a cruiser, and as you gaze\Nat the sun sinking below the horizon,

42
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,230
let your fingertips accidentally\Non purpose brush up against hers.

43
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,690
When she looks embarrassed,\Nsmile and take her hand.

44
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,320
{\i1}That's a tall order!{\i0}

45
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,110
{\i1}But that's okay.{\i0}

46
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,450
{\i1}I guess that's the kind of person\Nthe president is!{\i0}

47
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,450
I-I don't have the money to rent a cruiser.

48
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,540
I see.

49
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,580
Then,

50
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,580
get a part-time job!

51
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,090
A job?

52
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,210
I recommend it.

53
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,670
You work up a sweat. I swear, afterwards,\Nthe taste of the water from the fountain...

54
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,010
is as good as cola! I guarantee it!

55
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,970
{\i1}Why not just drink cola?{\i0}

56
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,220
{\i1}The president's workaholism\Nmight be coloring this argument.{\i0}

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,470
{\an8}I'm not saying you need\Nto rent a luxury liner.

58
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,220
{\an8}Right.

59
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,480
You can rent a small one\Nfor 10,000 or 20,000 yen.

60
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,980
But you need to have a license\Nto pilot a boat, don't you?

61
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,230
A small boat license is good enough.

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,030
It's easy to get, so I recommend it.

63
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,990
{\i1}He's got one!{\i0}

64
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,320
W-Wow! I'm impressed, President!

65
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,490
You can get one by taking a three-day course,\Nand it costs less than 100,000 yen.

66
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,740
But 100,000 yen is a lot of money to me.

67
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,370
So get a job!

68
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,870
{\an8}{\i1}Why do you try to keep pushing him\Ninto the workforce?{\i0}

69
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,090
Certainly, you're describing a great situation,\Nbut I've got a fundamental problem.

70
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,260
My hands get all sweaty\Nwhen I'm nervous.

71
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm afraid to take Miss Kashiwagi's hand\Nwhen mine is slick with sweat.

72
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,260
In other words...

73
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,140
{\an8}you have palmar hyperhidrosis!

74
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,520
{\an1}PALMAR HYPERHIDROSIS

75
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,520
{\an8}I don't know what that is,\Nbut you're probably right!

76
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
{\an8}{\i1}Don't make a diagnosis\Nbefore seeing a doctor!{\i0}

77
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,860
That would require surgery.

78
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,280
{\an8}Surgery for hyperhidrosis\Nruns about 100,000 yen!

79
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,910
Get a job! Okay?

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,660
TODAY

81
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,660
{\an6}OGASAWARA

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,660
{\an7}OKINAWA

83
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,500
{\i1}Why are you obsessed\Nwith making him work?{\i0}

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,670
Wouldn't it be more constructive...

85
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,420
to have a sweaty forehead from work\Nthan sweaty hands?

86
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,670
{\i1}That was a pretty good line!{\i0}

87
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,260
That decides it.

88
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,350
{\an8}For holding hands,\Na part-time job is essential!

89
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,930
{\an8}{\i1}Wrong! It isn't essential at all!{\i0}

90
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,560
As it happens, the place where I work\Nis looking for people for summer vacation.

91
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,940
Shall I inquire on your behalf?

92
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
President...

93
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,360
{\an8}Don't worry. I'd be with you.

94
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,740
{\an8}It's physical labor. It's tough at first.

95
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,280
{\an8}I'd be there every step of the way.

96
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,950
{\i1}Please, realize your basic mistake!{\i0}

97
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,530
{\an8}President!

98
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,200
The cost of the boat, license and surgery...\NWe're looking at about 200,000 yen.

99
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,330
The job pays 1,000 yen an hour,\Nso 5,000 yen for a five-hour shift.

100
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,960
If you work 40 days,\Nyou should be able to swing it.

101
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,090
You'll have a fun summer vacation!

102
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,960
I suppose so.

103
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,340
{\an8}{\i1}This is bad.{\i0}

104
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,140
{\an8}{\i1}At this rate, the president's summer vacation\Nwill be consumed by working!{\i0}

105
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,560
{\an8}{\i1}After my trouble coming up\Nwith summer vacation plans!{\i0}

106
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,600
{\an8}{\i1}They'll all be ruined!{\i0}

107
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,650
- I'll arrange an interview—\N- Hold it!

108
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,150
The color of her magnifying glass is pink!

109
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,530
{\an8}That's the color of truth!

110
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,690
{\an8}Enter the Love Detective!

111
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,530
{\an8}LOVE DETECTIVE CHIKA

112
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,530
Fujiwara and Shinomiya?

113
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,120
I'm not gonna let you\Ntalk about love without me!

114
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,200
Shinomiya...

115
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,290
I'm not part of this!

116
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,830
{\an8}I'm not a fool!

117
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,040
{\an8}It seems you're together.

118
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,960
So, what's the matter at hand?

119
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,420
Yes, the question was\Nhow he can hold his girlfriend's hand.

120
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,050
I see.

121
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,350
Huh? Can't he just normally\Ntake her by the hand?

122
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,680
What element is gumming up the works?

123
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,350
Well, the problematic aspect\Nis a high psychological hurdle.

124
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,690
Sweaty palms.

125
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,900
After my love sensor went off...

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,110
Is that the level\Nof male relationship advice?

127
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,910
That's cute.

128
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,910
You say it's nothing to worry about?

129
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,410
After all, the only advice here\Nis "Do your best," right?

130
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,410
"Do your best"? That's so vague.

131
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,170
It's not vague!

132
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,960
He's so nervous that his hands\Nget sweaty which is embarrassing!

133
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,460
And yet... And yet...

134
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,760
And yet, he screws up the courage,\Ntakes her hand, and it works out.

135
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,310
Right?

136
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,060
It wouldn't be fun if you could\Ngrab her hand without any effort!

137
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,060
Trying to skip the hard part\Nis a fundamental mistake!

138
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,060
Right?

139
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,150
{\an8}Reflect on that!

140
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,190
{\an8}FWISH

141
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,700
I-I see.

142
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,740
I was just lacking in pure will.

143
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,370
Just trying hard is enough?

144
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,540
What about the job?

145
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,830
He doesn't need it!

146
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,830
I don't believe it.

147
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,670
I'll do my best!

148
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,050
Although I've never held hands\Nwith a boy myself.

149
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,550
{\i1}Days later...{\i0}

150
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,180
{\i1}On a date with Kashiwagi,{\i0}

151
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,430
{\i1}he somehow succeeded\Nin holding Kashiwagi's hand.{\i0}

152
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,690
{\an8}{\i1}At any rate, I'm glad I protected\Nthe president's summer vacation.{\i0}

153
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,190
{\i1}Results of today's match...{\i0}

154
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:34,700
{\an8}RESULTS\NOF TODAY'S MATCH:

155
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,360
{\i1}Shirogane loses.{\i0}

156
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,700
{\an5}SHIROGANE LOSES\N(FAILED TO RECRUIT A PART-TIMER)

157
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,530
{\i1}Maybe Shinomiya could work there?{\i0}

158
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,360
{\i1}No, dream on.{\i0}

159
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,700
{\i1}If he really needs someone\Nto work there, he should ask me.{\i0}

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,210
Jeez, club activities suck.

161
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,080
Wha...

162
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,210
Club activities are important.

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,420
{\an8}KAGUYA WANTS HIM TO JOIN IN

164
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,840
Dedicating oneself to something\Ndevelops the body and mind.

165
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,220
No, I know\Nthat club activities are important.

166
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,720
Without them, students would have free time\Nand go on the path of delinquency.

167
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,100
Juvie, suspension,\Nthe breakdown of the family.

168
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,100
{\an5}MOM\NSOB SOB

169
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,900
In the end, they get pregnant,\Nand we do a fundraising campaign.

170
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,730
Club activities are also a way...

171
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,440
to keep mentally immature children\Nisolated from all that.

172
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,860
I didn't say that!

173
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,410
I mean, yes, there's that aspect to it.

174
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,120
{\i1}Club activities!{\i0}

175
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,750
{\i1}Two pyramids exist at Shuchiin Academy.{\i0}

176
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,580
{\an8}{\i1}One is the parentage pyramid.{\i0}

177

{\an1}DAUGHTER OF THE PRESIDENT\NOF A MAJOR SHIPBUILDING COMPANY

{\an6}DAUGHTER OF\NTHE PRESIDENT\NOF A FAMOUS I.T. COMPANY

183
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,090
{\an8}{\i1}Therefore, this is\Nthe ensuing balance of power.{\i0}

184
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,220
{\an3}ALL OTHERS\N(GENERAL PUBLIC)

{\an8}{\i1}It could be called\Nthe "Social Standing Hierarchy."{\i0}

{\an8}{\i1}The Club Caste!{\i0}

{\i1}regardless of actual performance\Nduring club activities.{\i0}

{\i1}Students who belong to no club\Nor cultural club members...{\i0}

197
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,320
{\i1}feel negatively about\Nthis unreasonable state of affairs.{\i0}

198
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,330
Those who are serious about it\Nare okay in my book.

199
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:07,750
But don't the majority put on "We're serious"\Nfaces while pretending to be best buddies?

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,670
That's a really cold thing.

201
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,670
It's like, what's fun about that?

202
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,170
They should do it\Nas if their lives depended on it!

203
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,760
I swear...

204
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,720
I wish they would all die.

205
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,850
{\i1}Shoot. Ishigami is off\Non one of his anti-youth rants.{\i0}

206
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,430
{\i1}I have to get him back on topic somehow.{\i0}

207
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,980
{\an8}Well, let's put a pin in that.

208
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,940
{\an8}About the club budget draft...

209
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,610
With the recent recession,

210
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,780
{\an7}2019 STUDENT COUNCIL\N(CLUB SPONSORSHIP)\NTREASURY BUDGET DRAFT

211
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,570
contributions are down.

212
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,860
We'll have to cut club budgets\Nwherever we can.

213
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,870
I definitely want to hear\Nyour opinion as treasurer.

214
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,740
Well, let's see.

215
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,750
Going from my experience\Ndoing accounting for the family business,

216
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,210
{\an9}NOTE: SON OF THE PRESIDENT\NOF A TOY MANUFACTURING\NCOMPANY

217
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,960
I have to say there's a lot of waste\Nin this proposed budget.

218
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,550
We should probably slash\Nthe soccer club's budget.

219
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,840
Okay, why?

220
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,800
{\an8}A lot of the members have girlfriends.

221
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,970
{\an8}That's your reason?

222
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,510
For the same reason, let's reduce the\Nbasketball club and the baseball club's budgets.

223
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,730
How about a 50,000 yen reduction\Nfor every couple?

224
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,850
Taxing couples?

225
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,810
Shouldn't those who are happy\Nbe taxed the most?

226
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,270
It's a happiness tax.

227
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:18,030
Even a tyrant wouldn't tax like that!\NThat's just a total personal grudge!

228
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,780
It is a personal grudge,\Nbut is that so bad?

229
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,990
It is bad! It's really bad!

230
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,660
You don't understand, President.

231
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,290
You don't understand my feelings!

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,540
{\an8}{\i1}Hey, you don't have a game\Nthis Sunday, do you?{\i0}

233
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,300
{\an8}{\i1}It's been a while, so let's go somewhere!{\i0}

234
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,510
{\an8}{\i1}Sorry. We have practice that day.{\i0}

235
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,760
{\an8}{\i1}Lately all you do is practice!{\i0}

236
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,720
{\i1}Sorry, but the tournament's coming up.{\i0}

237
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,010
{\i1}I know, but...{\i0}

238
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,730
{\i1}Right now,{\i0}

239
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,020
{\i1}I'm putting it all on the line for soccer.{\i0}

240
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,480
{\i1}Tak...{\i0}

241
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,520
{\an4}THROB

242
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,030
You burst into tears?

243
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,650
It's okay with me\Nthat they have girlfriends.

244
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,120
I'm so used to it that I don't feel\Nanything about it at this point.

245
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,540
If you've got a girlfriend, go on a date!

246
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,500
{\an8}Why are you even at practice?

247
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,250
If you've got a precious girlfriend,\Nwhat could be more important than her?

248
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,340
When I have nothing...

249
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,010
L-Look, you know a lot about computers.

250
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,850
Everyone says the same thing to otaku.

251
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,930
Maybe you should join one of those clubs.

252
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,640
Is it possible to be in a club\Nand also do student council?

253
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,900
Well, Shinomiya and Fujiwara do it,

254
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,480
so it's not impossible.

255
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,150
I see. What clubs are they in?

256
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,110
I believe Fujiwara belongs\Nto the tabletop game club.

257
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,910
I can imagine her enjoying that.

258
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,790
Shinomiya is in the Japanese archery club.

259
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,250
The Japanese archery club?

260
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,960
That really suits her.

261
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,000
How do you mean?

262
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,880
With Japanese archery,

263
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,630
if you've got breasts, the bowstring\Nrubs against them when you pull it back.

264
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,800
But with Shinomiya-senpai's size,\Nthere's no need to worry about that.

265
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,010
She's like this.

266
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,600
- Ishigami!\N- Just like this.

267
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,520
Behind you! Behind you!

268
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,600
{\an6}FWISH FWISH

269
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,770
{\an8}RUMBLE RUMBLE

270
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,310
Ishigami!

271
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,770
Ishigami!

272
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,270
I hear it's possible to bind your boobs\Nwith bandages up to D cup.

273
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,530
I'm sure Fujiwara-senpai\Nis way bigger than that,

274
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,530
so the day she tried Japanese archery,\Nher chest would be knocked all over the place!

275
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,780
They'd be like this!

276
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,330
{\an6}WOBBLE WOBBLE

277
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,120
{\an8}RUMBLE RUMBLE

278
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,910
Like this!

279
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,120
Hit the brakes, Ishigami!

280
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,120
Ishigami?

281
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,970
{\an7}GRIN

282
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,430
{\an8}FWAP FWAP

283
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,060
You're lucky, Ishigami.

284
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,190
Miss Fujiwara is kind,\Nso she'll forgive you.

285
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,770
She's probably the only one\Nwho'd forgive you.

286
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,070
{\an4}RUMBLE RUMBLE

287
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,820
I'm sure of it.

288
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,990
President, I'm going home\Nto write my will.

289
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,370
S-Sure.

290
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,080
But don't die.

291
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,830
It was a life full of liking\Nbig ones and small ones.

292
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,830
Were you two at your clubs?

293
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,090
Yes.

294
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,840
{\an8}President, please increase\Nthe budget of the tabletop game club.

295
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,720
I'll give you a cola.

296
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,970
{\an9}DAUGHTER OF\NA POLITICIAN

297
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,090
Don't offer me such an obvious bribe.

298
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,060
But I've never been in a club,\Nso I don't know what it's like.

299
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,850
Really?

300
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,940
{\an8}{\i1}Then, you should join my club.{\i0}

301
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,110
{\an8}{\i1}No! If I said that,{\i0}

302
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,530
{\an8}{\i1}it'd be like saying I wanted to be\Nin the same club as the president!{\i0}

303
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,110
{\an8}{\i1}I'm not really that...{\i0}

304
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,780
Then why don't you try joining my club?

305
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,870
{\i1}Tabletop game club, huh?{\i0}

306
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,250
{\an8}President, the budgets for the cultural clubs\Nhaven't changed much.

307
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,000
If you're there to observe\Nas a member of student council,

308
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,670
then logically, the sports clubs have had\Nthe major budget changes.

309
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,720
No, my club is special!

310
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,050
We always buy new games,\Nso it's like a money pit!

311
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,350
That doesn't endear me.

312
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,760
My club! Please join my club!

313
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,600
No!

314
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,890
You can't, no.

315
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,900
{\i1}Well, I don't really have time\Nto join a club because of my part-time job.{\i0}

316
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,650
{\i1}But I like this situation.\NIt feels like I'm popular.{\i0}

317
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,990
{\i1}I won't tell them I can't!{\i0}

318
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,660
{\i1}Results of today's match...{\i0}

319
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,910
RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:\NSHIROGANE WINS

320
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,040
{\i1}Shirogane wins.{\i0}

321
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,910
{\an7}BECAUSE FOR A SHORT TIME,\NHE'S ABLE TO FEEL LIKE HE HAS A HAREM

322
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,920
{\an8}I WANNA BE POPULAR.\NI WANNA BE POPULAR.

323
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,920
{\an1}PSYCHOANALYSIS

324
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,170
So, Pesu put Father's shoe\Nin his mouth and ran off.

325
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,840
{\an8}Father chased after him, yelling,\N"I'm not bread from Shizuoka Prefecture!"

326
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,140
KAGUYA WANTS TO CONTROL IT

327
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,510
{\an8}I held my sides with laughter!

328
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:08,440
{\an8}I love how you laugh, Miss Kaguya.

329
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,200
Wh-Where's that coming from?

330
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,320
After all, a long time ago,\Nyou didn't even crack a smile!

331
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,040
When we were in middle school,\Nthey called you "Kaguya the Ice Princess."

332
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,410
It was like you were in your own world.

333
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,830
I was like that back then, wasn't I?

334
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,380
After joining the student council, you were\Non bad terms with the president for a while.

335
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,050
{\i1}Shirogane, would you not look at me?{\i0}

336
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,640
{\i1}You were looking at me first.{\i0}

337
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,100
It was as comfortable\Nas sitting on thorns back then.

338
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,190
I-It was like that back then, wasn't it?

339
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,520
{\i1}I kept my distance from people\Nbecause I was afraid.{\i0}

340
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,480
{\i1}Miss Fujiwara was the only one\Nwho stayed by my side despite that.{\i0}

341
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,870
{\an8}{\i1}I have to treat her better.{\i0}

342
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,120
It's my dream to see you\Nroar with laughter someday!

343
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,420
I wouldn't let myself\Nlose control like that.

344
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,040
That's what you say,

345
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,340
but I bet you'd laugh\Nif you saw my Pesu doing tricks.

346
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,760
It's amazing!

347
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,630
{\an8}His wiener!

348
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,970
Is something wrong, Miss Kaguya?

349
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,390
I-I understand!\NYou mean your dog's trick, right?

350
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,610
{\an8}Perhaps you balance a hot dog on his nose,\Nand he waits for a command to eat it.

351
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,320
{\an8}I knew it!

352
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,150
{\i1}But I was just shocked\Nto hear the word "wiener"...{\i0}

353
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,910
{\an8}Anyway, he does the normal trick\Nlike putting one or two paws in your hand,

354
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,910
{\i1}suddenly coming out of the mouth\Nof a cute girl like Miss Fujiwara!{\i0}

355
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
but his wiener is really weird!

356
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,330
{\an8}How can I explain it?

357
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,910
{\an8}It hangs all the way to the left!

358
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,670
M-Miss Kaguya?

359
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,920
Sorry. I choked on my tea.

360
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,670
{\an8}SHIVER SHIVER

361
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,210
{\i1}Wh-What is this?{\i0}

362
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,880
{\i1}Why am I laughing\Nwhen I hear the word "wiener"?{\i0}

363
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,430
{\i1}Dirty jokes!{\i0}

364
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,220
{\an9}EASY\NPHYSICAL EDUCATION

365
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,720
{\i1}After learning from past mistakes,{\i0}

366
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,350
{\i1}Kaguya has begun to study the facts of life.{\i0}

367
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,060
{\an7}HMM HMM

368
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,060
{\i1}However,{\i0}

369
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,270
{\i1}regarding slang and metaphors, Kaguya's knowledge\Nis still at the level of a young grade-schooler.{\i0}

370
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,770
{\an8}But Pesu is sneaky!

371
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,690
{\an8}His wiener gets big when there's food,\Nbut otherwise, it's just a tiny stump!

372
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,110
{\an8}NORMAL

373
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,110
{\i1}So, right now,{\i0}

374
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,120
{\an8}SMALL

375
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,870
{\i1}Kaguya is at the stage where kids laugh\Nat words like "wiener" and "boobs"!{\i0}

376
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
{\an8}BIG

377
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,990
{\an8}NORMAL

378
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,870
{\an8}SMALL

379
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,740
{\an8}BIG

380
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,620
{\i1}Everyone goes through this period,\Nand Kaguya is smack-dab in the middle of it!{\i0}

381
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,620
{\an8}NORMAL

382
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,500
{\an8}SMALL

383
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,620
{\an8}BIG

384
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,920
Kaguya?

385
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,880
Stop it already!

386
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,050
{\an8}{\i1}If she realizes I'm laughing\Nat a vulgar word like that,{\i0}

387
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,880
{\an8}{\i1}the Shinomiya family\Nwill never live down my shame!{\i0}

388
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,220
{\i1}It's my dream to see you\Nroar with laughter someday.{\i0}

389
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,890
{\an8}{\i1}Making Miss Fujiwara's dream come true\Nwith a wiener would just be despicable!{\i0}

390
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,640
{\i1}I have to reset my feelings!{\i0}

391
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,190
Are you...

392
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,400
Wiener.

393
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,660
Wiener.

394
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,420
{\an8}Please! Stop it!

395
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,090
{\an8}I'm begging you!

396
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,800
{\an8}M-Miss Kaguya is roaring with laughter!

397
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,340
{\an8}{\i1}I'm thrilled!{\i0}

398
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,050
{\an8}{\i1}Fujiwara's dream came true.{\i0}

399
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,220
M-Miss Fujiwara?

400
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,310
You will stop, won't you?

401
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,060
{\i1}Of course she wouldn't stop.{\i0}

402
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,810
{\an8}WILLIE THE ELEPHANT\NNICE TO MEET YOU!

403
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,390
{\i1}Just as a parent\Nwill continue tickling their child...{\i0}

404
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,810
{\an8}Wiener! Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

405
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,020
{\i1}when the child demands them to stop,{\i0}

406
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,570
{\i1}nothing could make\Nthe overjoyed Fujiwara stop!{\i0}

407
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,230
{\an8}This is fun!

408
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,150
{\an8}{\i1}President?{\i0}

409
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,280
Hi.

410
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,030
President.

411
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,040
Listen, Miss Fujiwara!\NDon't you dare do that in front of a boy!

412
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,420
{\an1}GRIN

413
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,420
{\an8}{\i1}She's not going to stop!{\i0}

414
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,250
It'll be okay. I'm a young lady.

415
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,420
I could never say that word\Nin front of a boy.

416
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,510
{\an8}At least not out of my mouth.

417
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,930
{\an8}{\i1}No! There's some hidden meaning\Nto her words!{\i0}

418
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,390
{\an8}Say, President!

419
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,060
What do you call that little dog\Nthat looks like a sausage again?

420
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,350
Dachshund?

421
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,310
{\an8}{\i1}Wiener dog?{\i0}

422
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,440
{\i1}She intends to make\Nthe president say "wiener"!{\i0}

423
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,070
{\i1}If the president says that word,{\i0}

424
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,570
{\an8}{\i1}I won't be able to keep myself\Nfrom laughing!{\i0}

425
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,410
{\i1}I can't let the president say "wiener"!{\i0}

426
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,830
{\an8}But isn't there\Nanother weird expression for it?

427
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,580
{\i1}I gotta stop this!{\i0}

428
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,830
{\an8}{\i1}Think!{\i0}

429
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,370
{\an8}{\i1}Use all of your brain cells, Kaguya Shinomiya!{\i0}

430
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,920
Oh, isn't it "wien"—

431
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,090
Hot dog!

432
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,840
{\an8}I heard that's what they sometimes\Ncall it in the U.S.

433
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,930
What's that Viennese breaded,\Npan-fried cutlet called?

434
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,470
- Wien—\N- Schnitzel.

435
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,730
It's similar to our tonkatsu.

436
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,890
What's the common name for a hot dog?

437
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,190
- Wie—\N- Frankfurter!

438
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,770
The term comes from Frankfurt, Germany,\Nwhere sausages like hot dogs originated.

439
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,150
Um, what else? What else?\NI can't think of anything!

440
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,410
What? What is this about?

441
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,620
{\i1}I held the fort!{\i0}

442
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,660
{\an8}{\i1}Now the president won't say the word "wiener"!{\i0}

443
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,790
{\an8}{\i1}I'm out of danger!{\i0}

444
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,500
Darn it! President, I wanted "wiener"\Nto come out of your mouth!

445
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,420
Every time you were about to give me "wiener,"\NMiss Kaguya would get in the way!

446
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,880
P-Perverts!

447
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,720
I would never do anything like that here!\NWhat in the world are you thinking?

448
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,180
Are you nymphos?

449
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,850
Are you nymphomaniacs?

450
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,850
{\an8}I...

451
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,980
I'm not like her!

452
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,240
{\an8}Why...

453
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,780
{\an8}is this happening?

454
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,370
Wiener.

455
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,370
{\an5}BFFT

456
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,240
Enough! Stop it already!

457
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,870
That's too funny!

458
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,080
I've had enough wieners!

459
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,880
Miss Fujiwara,\Nwhen are you going to be satisfied?

460
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,340
Stop torturing me with wieners!

461
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,380
Miss Kaguya, your response\Njust makes me feel so good.

462
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,010
{\an8}{\i1}S-Something unspeakable\Nis happening behind this door!{\i0}

463
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,550
Why don't we switch?\NYou take the wiener part!

464
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,510
No way! You won't see that\Ncome out of my mouth!

465
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,470
Oh, like you never have before!

466
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,270
One or two more wieners won't hurt!

467
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,350
Forget it!

468
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,350
Wiener!

469
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,770
Wiener! Wiener!

470
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,520
{\i1}Results of today's match...{\i0}

471
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,320
{\i1}Fujiwara wins.{\i0}

472
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,110
Wiener!

473
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Um, do you have one?
