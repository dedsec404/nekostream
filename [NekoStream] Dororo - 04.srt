1
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,220
Party is over

2
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,440
But I still wanna dance

3
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,150
I can't even sleep

4
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Someday, one day my passion's fire will

5
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,660
From the beginning I knew

6
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,370
One day the flames would die out

7
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,290
Hey, I thought I didn't need anything

8
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,790
But even now, I'm so serious

9
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,670
Ah... I still have time to make it

10
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,470
Ah... but I'm gonna burn it up, baby

11
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,430
Sorry darling, it's not that easy

12
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,140
But surely it's not that bad either

13
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,770
Give me fire

14
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,780
Light it up, baby.   I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

15
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,300
Party is over

16
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,130
Sorry darling Hurry up   Ah... I still have time to make it

17
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,970
Sorry darling Hurry up   Ah... I still have time to make it

18
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,850
Give me fire

19
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,850
Light it up, baby.   I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

20
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,900
#4 The story of the cursed sword

21
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,220
You there.

22
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,970
Give it up.

23
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,930
He can't hear a word you're saying.

24
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,220
He's deaf up here.

25
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,060
Been standing there for half an hour now.

26
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,230
He's as wet as a drowned rat.

27
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,070
He can catch a cold for all I care.

28
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,990
The rain. I think he's listening to the rain.

29
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,540
Huh? I told you, he can't hear.

30
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,250
I just have a feeling.

31
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,130
You're from a rich family, aren't ya?

32
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,340
Pretty words and a ladylike face.

33
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,850
You're not some country girl.

34
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,100
I'm right, aren't I?

35
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,730
Well.

36
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,570
The past is the past. I'm just another peddler now.

37
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,030
Whatever.

38
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,820
Hey, what were you praying so hard about just now?

39
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,160
Good business?

40
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,830
I was praying that my brother would come home soon.

41
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,370
Where'd he go?

42
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,710
To fight a war. It's been 5 years now.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,300
5 years? If it's been that long, he's probably already...

44
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,550
Help... me...

45
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,900
Oh no.

46
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,820
Where are you going?

47
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,860
Boys?

48
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,710
Why'd you run off like that?

49
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,010
What the heck?

50
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,090
How could anyone do such a thing?

51
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,650
Where'd you come from?

52
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,520
Did you do this?

53
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,950
Dammit, why the hell did you do this?

54
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,200
This sword was thirsty for blood.

55
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,240
And so I killed them.

56
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,540
A thirsty sword? Give me a break!

57
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,960
This is no ordinary sword.

58
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,290
It's alive, a cursed sword that drinks human blood.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,710
Once you have it in your hands,

60
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,550
it controls your body to kill anyone alive.

61
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,220
So you're blaming that sword for all this?

62
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,010
Then what about that?

63
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,310
That smirk on your face.

64
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,050
You are like me.

65
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,430
There is a demon in that blade.

66
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,800
But it's not as quick as mine.

67
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,750
Hey, Hyakkimaru.

68
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,510
Did you get him?

69
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,260
He fell from here?

70
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,510
I guess he's... Hey.

71
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,020
Your leg, huh. Hold on.

72
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,280
Where is it?

73
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,030
There it is. That sword, too.

74
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,290
It's so creepy. I'm throwing it away.

75
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,880
Boys?

76
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,880
Where are you?

77
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,850
Brother...!

78
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,950
Brother!

79
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,920
I'm so glad, you've come to.

80
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,250
Osushi.

81
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,130
Yes, it is I.

82
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,130
I prayed so hard for so long.

83
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,260
That you would come home safely.

84
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,890
So having you here...

85
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,890
What is it?

86
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,350
Are you looking for something?

87
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,400
It's nothing.

88
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,280
It'll come back to me anyway.

89
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,870
Dang it, I don't want to go that way.

90
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Let go of me, geez!

91
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,050
You stupid sword...

92
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,800
Whacha doin there, boy?

93
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,800
Head on back to town. There's danger in these woods...

94
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,110
It's the phantom killer!

95
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,070
I won't let you...!

96
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,120
Forgive me, Osushi.

97
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,670
To fight is a samurai's duty.   Please understand.

98
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,800
Father and Mother will look over us.

99
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,180
I won't be gone long.

100
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,850
My dear brother...

101
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,120
Brother.

102
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,700
They were selling this out on the street.

103
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,710
Chestnut rice. You've always liked it, haven't you?

104
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,220
Remember how when I was a child, I'd never stop crying once I got started?

105
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,470
No matter how much Mother tried, I'd keep crying and crying.

106
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,480
And when that happened, you'd come to me.

107
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,940
And fold a paper crane.

108
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,400
I'd stop crying just like that.

109
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,950
And I'd sit there and gaze at the crane.

110
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,890
I'm here.

111
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,060
Right here.

112
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,230
He's here! The phantom killer!

113
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,670
Hyakkimaru.

114
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,220
Brother, let us go home. Come home with me.

115
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,690
Please, say something.

116
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,690
What happened to you?

117
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,780
What made you like this?

118
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,070
Kill him. Kill him now.

119
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,870
Slice his head off, Tanosuke.

120
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,580
He has built quite a magnificent castle   for me.

121
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,250
Not even a great army   could conquer it easily.

122
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,970
But if he double crosses us, he could expose its weaknesses.

123
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,220
It'd be less secure than a sandcastle.

124
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,140
We must kill him before that happens.

125
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,230
Please reconsider, my lord!

126
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,320
Do you disobey me?

127
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,660
Then take your own life with this sword.

128
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,740
That's an old sword   that had been stored away.

129
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,740
It's rusty and dull.   Just right for you, don't you think?

130
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,950
Now kill him. Kill him!

131
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,060
That sword is said to become sharper   as it soaks in more blood.

132
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,640
Of course, it's only a rumor.

133
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,350
But there's enough blood here to find out.

134
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,170
Nihiru. That is your name.

135
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,720
My lord.

136
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,760
It wants more blood.

137
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,890
Nihiru says so.

138
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,860
Do you want more blood?

139
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,570
Leave it to me.

140
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,290
I'll give you more.

141
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,120
As much as you wish.

142
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,630
It's here.

143
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,920
Don't go!

144
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,470
Brother...

145
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,590
Osushi.

146
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,930
You dummy, stop!

147
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
It's me, can't you tell?

148
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,980
Damn it.

149
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,620
Let go of me, Osushi.

150
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,540
Please, Brother.

151
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,410
Don't go, please.

152
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,960
-Let go. -Brother!

153
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,670
Out of my way.

154
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,640
Everything has changed.

155
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,390
I couldn't defend the house nor the land on my own.

156
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,180
It's long gone.

157
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,190
But with you here with me, we could live again like before...

158
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,530
Please...

159
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,150
Stay here with me.

160
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,700
I don't care if you're not the same anymore.

161
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:38,970
Brother.

162
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,560
Brother?

163
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,810
Nihiru is calling for me.

164
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,690
Brother!

165
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,050
Hyakkimaru, you...

166
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,310
Thanks, Hyakkimaru.

167
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,270
Thanks...

168
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,950
This sword is mine.

169
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,290
Mine and only mine.

170
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,630
Why did you let me live?

171
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,920
You should have killed me,

172
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,640
before I got Nihiru back in my hands.

173
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,700
Brother?

174
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,760
Wait, please!

175
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,520
Don't kill my brother!

176
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,380
Brother...

177
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,560
Brother...

178
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,830
What...?

179
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,890
We searched everywhere, but couldn't find the midwife.

180
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,680
Nothing about the baby, either.

181
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,010
Sorrow scatters in the wind,

182
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,810
piling up to form shadows

183
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:39,520
Our footsteps admonish indifference in such verbose ways

184
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,070
As I peek into your fathomless eyes, I lose my composure

185
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:52,030
Is there any hope in the place I am heading to?

186
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,290
I feign amusement and laugh

187
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,580
because this road is so dark

188
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:06,300
I will be there to shine the light

189
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,720
I'm used to playing at saying goodbye,

190
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,930
but I cried when I waved to you

191
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,220
Our fiery woes fade... and fade...

192
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,230
until night falls upon us

193
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,730
If I knew tomorrow would be so mundane,

194
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,940
I wouldn't have said that I wanted to live

195
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:32,820
I know it's futile but can't help dreaming of a future... a future... you are to blame

196
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,930
"Nihiru"
