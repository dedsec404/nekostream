1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,650
Welcome.

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,700
Man, don't come to show off every time you buy a new slave.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,820
That's not it.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,660
Another young girl?

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,200
You really are a lolicon, huh?

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,330
Wrong!

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,620
Master, I'm hungry.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,080
Want a bite?

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,630
Yeah, thanks!

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,290
Hey, Filo.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,550
It's fine, missy.

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,380
How big a bite could she take, anyway?

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,100
Time to dig in!

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,310
That was so-so, I guess.

15
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,340
The Rising of the Shield Hero

16
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,830
A New Comrade

17
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,830
So, what's her deal?

18
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,370
According to the slave merchant,

19
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,630
filolials have a king or queen leading each flock.

20
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,130
Isn't that just a myth?

21
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,920
Those kings and queens are highly skilled at transforming,

22
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,300
and they blend into the flocks by disguising themselves as normal filolials.

23
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,310
And they can transform into humans, too?

24
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,770
That's nuts.

25
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,150
What's more, it turns out they need a special crest to be tamed.

26
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,900
I hadn't budgeted for that.

27
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,530
Things got crazy while giving her that crest.

28
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,740
Filo started resisting with all her might.

29
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,160
And that was at Level 19.

30
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,170
Who knows how strong she'll be at Level 70 or something?

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,590
And? You didn't come here just to show off this filolial queen, right?

32
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,670
Sell us some clothes.

33
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,630
Clothes?

34
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,520
If she rips them apart each time she transforms,

35
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,600
I'll go broke in the blink of an eye.

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,520
There are outfits made for transforming species, aren't there?

37
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,650
Those are special. I ain't got any.

38
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,560
Go see a dressmaker.

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,610
But I guess you can't have her walking around in public looking like that.

40
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,740
Take this. Another customer left it here.

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,280
Wow, cute!

42
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,160
She's cute, like an angel!

43
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,620
Wait, she has wings on her back, so maybe she really is one?

44
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,790
Am I cute, Master?

45
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,840
Don't ask me.

46
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,800
You mustn't be like that, Father.

47
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,710
Fath—?!

48
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,180
Compliments help girls grow ever cuter.

49
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,260
Master, are you my father?

50
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,720
No, I'm your owner.

51
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,770
What about Raphtalia-oneechan, then?

52
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,400
She's like my daughter.

53
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,730
I am not!

54
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,320
Anyway, that doesn't matter.

55
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
It doesn't?

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,110
We want clothes that don't rip when you transform and can go back to normal later.

57
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,450
Oh, that's what you're looking for?

58
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,950
Did you bring magic thread?

59
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,500
Magic thread?

60
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,880
Transforming clothes are always woven using thread made out of the wearer's own mana.

61
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,090
So, they're custom made?

62
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,880
Indeed!

63
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,090
If you give me the magic threads,

64
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,850
I'll make you the cutest dress ever!

65
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,730
Magic thread, huh?

66
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,190
You certainly could spin it here,

67
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,860
but not right now. My magic gemstone broke recently.

68
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,070
Is that gemstone expensive?

69
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,240
It is, but the bigger issue is that it's always in short supply.

70
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,700
Well, that's a problem.

71
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,200
I'll talk to people and try to procure one as soon as possible.

72
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,290
Could you give me some time?

73
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,250
Hey.

74
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,500
What is this?

75
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,760
A crystal ball. It measures one's magical affinity.

76
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,970
Let me check yours, too.

77
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,930
No outfit for a while, huh?

78
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,220
Filo has wind affinity!

79
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,190
I blow away all the enemies!

80
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,520
My job is draw the carriage.

81
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,650
Well, she's in a good mood.

82
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,980
To where my Master says!

83
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,320
If I find the spear guy,

84
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,080
I'll send him flying with a full-power kick!

85
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,500
It'll be a while before we get her clothes.

86
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,710
In the meantime, let's travel around and make some money.

87
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,420
That trade pass we got from the village lord will come in handy.

88
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,130
Master, there's someone up ahead.

89
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,130
Is something the matter?

90
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,100
P-Please, give me a ride on your carriage.

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,720
Huh?

92
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,310
I need to get this medicine to the village past the mountain at once!

93
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,730
Filo, how long will it take to get there at full speed?

94
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,690
Not long.

95
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,820
But we can get there even sooner without the carriage.

96
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,740
I'll take you there for one silver.

97
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,870
But I already spent all my money on the medicine...

98
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,580
You can pay me in goods, or even pay me later.

99
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,250
Don't you dare try to weasel out of it, though.

100
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,170
Th-That would be fine.

101
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,040
Give me the reins, Raphtalia.

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,840
Here.

103
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,880
Thank you.

104
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
I don't need your gratitude. Just make sure to pay me.

105
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,590
Go, Filo!

106
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,470
Right-o!

107
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,520
Halt! Pay the toll!

108
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,900
I'll come back for it later!

109
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,740
Mother, I got you the medicine.

110
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,080
You go boil some water.

111
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,960
I'll give her the medicine.

112
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,920
But...

113
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,290
Relax. I won't charge you.

114
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,800
Potion Enhance

115
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,310
Why, thank you.

116
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,270
Mother!

117
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,530
The medicine's helping already?

118
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,240
Yes. The pain went away in an instant.

119
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,910
Thank you.

120
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,910
Um... What kind of magic spell did you use?

121
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,210
Quit asking questions you don't need to ask.

122
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,540
That aside...

123
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,750
Oh, here. This should be worth one silver in total.

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,300
That works.

125
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,470
Later.

126
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,680
Thank you so very much!

127
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,520
On top of selling goods, I can even provide transport for people.

128
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,100
Traveling trade may actually be more profitable than I thought.

129
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,470
I can't believe I get to ride withOur Savior of the Heavenly Fowl.

130
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,760
"Our Savior of the Heavenly Fowl"?

131
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
You've become quite famous around these parts.

132
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,230
"Traveling in a carriage drawn by the god of domesticated birds,

133
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,400
Our Savior crosses the land to treat the sick with his special medicine!"

134
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,480
Am I a god?

135
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,320
Hey! Didn't Naofumi-sama tell you not to talk with strangers around?

136
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,450
Sorry.

137
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,290
She can talk, too? That's thegod of domesticated birds for you!

138
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,700
She's not a god or anything.

139
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,120
Naofumi-sama, there are people blocking the path.

140
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,340
Whoa, stop right there!

141
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,760
Strange bird you've got there.

142
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,720
We heard an accessory seller was hitching a ride with you.

143
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,510
We know you're in there!

144
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,560
He was a client with baggage, huh?

145
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,100
Quietly hand him over, and we'll spare your lives, at least.

146
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,940
You mean you'll take everything but our lives?

147
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,820
You're a sharp one, lad.

148
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,070
That girl's pretty hot for a demi-human.

149
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,870
Looks like we can have ourselves some fun tonight.

150
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,500
Naofumi-sama, may I cut him down?

151
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,460
Not like you'd listen to me if I said no.

152
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,370
Me too!

153
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,330
Don't bother.

154
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,960
We've got a class-upgraded bodyguard.

155
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,220
We're counting on you, Sensei!

156
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,300
Class-upgraded?

157
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
Yet another unfamiliar term.

158
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,930
If nothing else, I can tell he won't be easy pickings.

159
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,350
If only I could use support magic right now...

160
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,730
As source of thy power, I order thee.

161
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,990
Decipher the laws of nature and conceal me in a haze.

162
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,820
Hide Mirage!

163
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,370
Fast Tornado!

164
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,080
Some other trader told us to mug the guy riding with you

165
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,920
because he was carrying a bunch of nice stuff!

166
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,260
One of my own sold me out, huh?

167
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,840
Well? What do we do with these guys?

168
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,720
Usually, you'd hand them over to the local guards.

169
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,570
Aren't you the Shield Hero?

170
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,900
It was obvious since you had no weapons, only a shield.

171
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,150
"We're unlucky adventurers who were attacked by the cruel Shield Hero!"

172
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,320
Is that what you'll tell the guards?

173
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,490
Exactly.

174
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,080
They'll surely take our word over the Shield Hero's.

175
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,500
Then you leave me no choice.

176
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,290
You'll have to die.

177
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,500
Filo, are you hungry?

178
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,040
I am!

179
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,460
Food!

180
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,510
She's an omnivore, you see.

181
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,050
And she'll gulp anything down in one go.

182
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,590
Aren't you Our Savior of the Heavenly Fowl?

183
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,600
Do you really want to commit murder?!

184
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm no savior, and I need to act in my best interests.

185
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,350
You must've killed plenty of people so far.

186
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,480
Just consider this your turn, and give up.

187
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,400
W-Wait, please! Anything but our lives!

188
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,650
Got it.

189
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,650
I'll spare your lives, at least.

190
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,320
However...

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,710
We're looting the bandits?

192
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,970
Doesn't this make us more evil than the criminals?

193
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,380
You're wrong there.

194
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,390
They offered up everything they had to purchase their lives from Our Savior.

195
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,850
He's treating even lives as merchandise.

196
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:38,360
Sir Hero's a shining example of the trader's spirit that's so rare nowadays!

197
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,940
I'm pretty sure this is just intimidation.

198
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,990
You two... Less talk, more work.

199
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,200
Also, how are you going to compensate me for all this trouble you caused?

200
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,370
I offer you all the knowledge and connections I possess.

201
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,830
Knowledge and connections?

202
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,800
Yes. I've taken a real liking to you.

203
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,050
The first things the accessory seller taught me

204
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,600
were how to process precious metals, use the tools required,

205
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,100
craft gems, and imbue them with mana.

206
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,070
I even managed to pick up some spells, thanks to getting a feel for mana.

207
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,610
And so, I gained a new business venture: crafting gemstones.

208
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,200
Then I gained an in with the traders' grapevine,

209
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,490
where I heard rumors of the other heroes.

210
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,750
Apparently, Motoyasu saved a famine-stricken village to the southwest

211
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,880
by introducing a legendary crop.

212
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,300
I bet that goddamn slut put him up to it.

213
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,720
Ren's apparently southeast,looking for vicious monsters to slay.

214
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,100
I even heard a rumor that said he took down a dragon.

215
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,640
But the information regarding Itsuki, the Bow Hero, was all over the place.

216
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,900
Some said he's training up in the mountains,

217
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,110
and some said he went into a dungeon on a quest for treasure.

218
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,950
There were even some tall tales, like him joining another country's resistance,

219
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,240
but none of them were credible.

220
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,790
That seller certainly did provide us with ample knowledge and connections.

221
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,170
But one thing he offered helped me more than any other.

222
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,840
Yes, this deed is genuine.

223
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,840
I'm amazed that grumpy money-grubber actually gave this to you.

224
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,010
Anyway, if there's a gemstone you want, I can arrange getting it for you.

225
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,430
At a discount, of course.

226
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,190
What would you like?

227
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,110
I want the gemstone used to make magic threads.

228
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,780
I'm amazed you learned where to find that gemstone so quickly.

229
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,660
It's not all good news.

230
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,790
It seems to be in a rather dicey location.

231
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,080
Naofumi-sama...

232
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,550
This temple was once a notoriously evil alchemist's base of operations.

233
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,430
I never knew there was a tunnel here.

234
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,100
According to the mining chief,

235
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,230
nobody's dared approach this place since some monsters nested here.

236
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,900
Stay on your toes.

237
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,490
It's empty.

238
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,370
That's ancient writing.

239
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,330
"We pray this seed never makes it out of here.

240
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,000
It is a horribly twisted manifestation of our wish

241
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,880
for nobody to starve."

242
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,090
Looks like some bandits already released it into the world, though.

243
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,590
Master, there's a path down this way.

244
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,140
Let's go.

245
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,560
Hey, Filo! What are you doing?

246
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Hurry up!

247
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,360
Oh, Master!

248
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,440
You see...

249
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,320
For crying out loud.

250
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,030
If you won't listen to me, then I don't need you anymore.

251
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,450
Stop.

252
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,740
What is that?

253
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,410
A monster footprint.

254
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,750
It must be a rather large one.

255
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,000
But we have to keep going until we get what we're here for.

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,880
Just be care—

257
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,800
Naofumi-sama?!

258
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,010
Stay calm!

259
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,550
Hey, witch! What's going on?

260
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,810
I'm sick and tired of being Naofumi-sama's slave.

261
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:43,100
I only pretended to become his slave again so I could kill him with my own hands.

262
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,400
I can stab him clean through from behind now.

263
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,150
Don't let the voices mislead you!

264
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,900
The witch?

265
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,530
The monsters here provoke you by saying the last things you want to hear,

266
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,780
in the last voices you want saying them!

267
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,740
How nasty is that?

268
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,950
Master is my food!

269
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,830
Hey, something cut me!

270
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,000
Do something about this!

271
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,750
As source of thy power, I order thee.

272
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,420
Decipher the laws of nature and restore our sight!

273
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,260
Fast Anti-Bind!

274
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,550
If we can see them...

275
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,050
Filo!

276
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,140
I'm gonna blow you away!

277
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,980
Are you all okay?

278
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,150
Yes, I'm fine.

279
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,860
I don't think this will come in handy.

280
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,860
Voice Gengar Shield (Bat Form)

281
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,240
Let's keep going.

282
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,490
You won't abandon me, right, Master?

283
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,330
I've got money riding on you.

284
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,120
I won't get rid of you easily.

285
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,870
Naofumi-sama...

286
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,750
Don't worry.

287
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,210
Naofumi-sama would never say mean things like those hallucinations you heard.

288
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,970
Okay, I'll believe in him.

289
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,390
It's nothing. Never mind.

290
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,690
Something's in there.

291
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,950
That's the gemstone.

292
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,870
Yeah, but...

293
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,120
That's a nue.

294
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,460
It's on the small side, but still dangerous.

295
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,080
This'll be rough.

296
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,130
The gemstone's right there, but we can't get it.

297
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,960
We're going!

298
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,260
Those two!

299
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,800
Cover us, please!

300
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,930
Zweit Fire Blast!

301
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,360
Naofumi-sama!

302
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,690
Can I hold it off?

303
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,740
Don't!

304
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,070
Hey!

305
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,200
That was close...

306
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,120
We need to avoid that at all costs.

307
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,040
But then how do we attack it?

308
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,970
Watch out, Raphtalia!

309
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,930
It can see her?

310
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,970
No. It hears her.

311
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,930
It's really sensitive to sound.

312
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,230
Sound?

313
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,400
Filo! Yell in here as loud as you can!

314
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,980
Okay!

315
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,110
Everyone, cover your ears!

316
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,950
Now!

317
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,160
Zweit Fire Blast!

318
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,760
We won!

319
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,340
Are you unhurt?

320
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,090
Yeah!

321
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,550
You?

322
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,930
I'm fine.

323
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,010
Don't charge in so recklessly.

324
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,890
But...

325
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,940
What if you got a scar that never faded?

326
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,020
You're worried about my...

327
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,310
Are we clear?

328
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,520
Y-Yes.

329
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,900
Wow, so pretty!

330
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,950
It really is beautiful!

331
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,630
This is making me tired...

332
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,970
It's because you're converting your mana into thread.

333
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,970
Endure it for just a while longer.

334
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,930
I'll give you a snack once you finish.

335
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,560
A yummy one? Then I'll keep going!

336
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
How do I look, Master?

337
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,830
Very nice.

338
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,000
Yay! Thank you, Master!

339
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,960
I mean, sure, she looks cute...

340
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,090
Doesn't she?!

341
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:25,580
I did my very best to bring out every last bit of Filo-chan's angelic charm!

342
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,360
I used white as the base color, to go with her wings.

343
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,590
I added in plenty of frills as a nod to her feathers, too.

344
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,000
And since it'd contrast best with her blonde hair,

345
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I went with blue for the ribbon!

346
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,510
R-Right...

347
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:44,140
The monster crest and magic outfit add up to 340 silvers in total.

348
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,410
You'd better work hard to pay it off.

349
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,880
Yeah! I'll do my best!

350
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,050
Don't suddenly transform indoors!

351
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,140
The ribbon looks oh-so-cute even in her monster form!

352
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,080
Don't you agree?

353
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,510
You agree, don't you, Father?

354
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,770
Don't ask me!

355
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:40,050
The Savior of the Heavenly Fowl

356
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,050
