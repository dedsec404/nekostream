1
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,620
Splendidly done, brave heroes.

2
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,200
Tonight, we celebrate!

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,790
Enjoy yourselves to the fullest!

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,710
Hooray!

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,920
That's the heroes for you.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,960
Our country has nothing to worry about.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,720
Screw this party.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,970
I never would have come here if it wasn't for the reward.

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,930
I hear the casualties were in the single digits this time.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,100
Bless our heroes.

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,650
I held my ground against a massive monster

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,320
and fought with pride as a royal knight...

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,860
What?

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,530
I'm truly honored to meet you, Spear Hero.

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,820
Do you happen to have a lover?

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,120
Motoyasu-sama is still tired from the battle.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,330
You there.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
Motoyasu-sama...

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,800
Naofumi-sama...

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,720
Aren't you hungry?

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,260
The food here seems heavenly!

22
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,510
If you want to eat, go ahead.

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,730
You should join me.

24
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,600
I'll pass.

25
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,530
Persons or objects can be registered to allow them to beteleported with you when summoned by the hourglass.

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,700
Teleport people with me, huh?

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,830
Persons or objects can be registered to allow them to beteleported with you when summoned by the hourglass.

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,740
If only I'd noticed this sooner...

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,370
Let's eat together.

30
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,750
Have a bite.

31
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,250
No, I...

32
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,880
It's really good, you know?

33
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,960
See?

34
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,510
Naofumi...

35
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,310
Duel me.

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,250
The Rising of the Shield Hero

37
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,580
Lullaby at Dawn

38
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,540
I heard that Raphtalia-chan's your slave.

39
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,370
And what if she is?

40
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,580
You...

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Raphtalia is my slave.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,380
So what?

43
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,260
Listen! It's not right to enslave others!

44
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,830
Listen to yourself.

45
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,970
Slavery is legal in this country, anyway.

46
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,850
But we're heroes from another world!

47
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,980
We can't behave that way here!

48
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,100
That's just your opinion.

49
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,310
I disagree.

50
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,020
Fight me!

51
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,440
If I win, free Raphtalia-chan.

52
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,780
And what if I win?

53
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,700
Then... you can keep things as they are.

54
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,330
Ridiculous.

55
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,250
Naofumi-sama?

56
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,290
He has a slave in his party?

57
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,710
I thought he couldn't stoop any lower, but he has.

58
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,670
I overheard your conversation.

59
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,180
A hero, using a demi-human as his slave?

60
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,140
It seems that you are rotten to the core.

61
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,060
I order you to accept his challenge!

62
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,650
That won't be necessary!

63
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,400
I'm with Naofumi-sama of my own free will.

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,850
What are you playing at?!

65
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,820
Poor girl.

66
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,330
You've been placed under a curse that compels you to defend your master.

67
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,710
Don't worry.

68
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,330
Once Motoyasu-dono wins, we shall release you from that curse.

69
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,790
Hey! Knock it off!

70
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,130
Draw your swords!

71
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,640
If you won't heed my order,I shall take her from you by force.

72
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,470
I hope you're not thinking of running from this.

73
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,180
You scumbag!

74
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,270
If I win, you'd better return Raphtalia!

75
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,520
And how exactly will you win, Shield Hero?

76
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,370
The duel between the Spear Hero and the Shield Hero will now begin!

77
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:02,250
This duel will end when one of the combatants is pinned or admits defeat.

78
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,050
Legendary Weapon Rule Violation:Holding non-assigned weapon.

79
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,900
This duel will take place in the presence of King Melromarc and the Pope,

80
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,280
and it is thus legitimate and official.

81
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,910
Motoyasu-sama!

82
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,450
Best of luck!

83
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,790
Remember that folk tale about theirresistible spear and the immovable shield?

84
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,300
Naofumi, be a man and admit defeat.

85
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,140
Ready...

86
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,140
Begin!

87
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,650
You stopped it?

88
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,570
I guess you're not the Shield Hero for nothing.

89
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,240
You lose.

90
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,370
In this battle between an irresistible spear and an immovable shield,

91
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,950
you lost the moment you couldn't pierce my shield!

92
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,130
Chaos Spear!

93
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,980
Damn!

94
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,480
A strike using the shield? It would never...

95
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,360
Ow!

96
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,530
Wh-Why?

97
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,700
A balloon? What's that doing here?

98
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,290
What the hell are you playing at?

99
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,460
If I can't win anyway, I might as well make you as miserable as I can.

100
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,420
Screw you!

101
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,670
Fight me fair and square!

102
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,800
Two-Headed Black Dog Shield Exclusive Skill: Dog Bite

103
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,640
Get off me!

104
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,180
Air Strike Shield!

105
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,230
Shield Prison!

106
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,610
Hey! Stop that!

107
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,650
Shit!

108
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,240
That hurts! Knock it off, you cowardly cheat!

109
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,150
It can't be.

110
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,240
If this keeps up, the Shield Hero might win.

111
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,580
Naofumi-san's got the upper hand.

112
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,200
Yeah.

113
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:47,130
What does that lowly Shield Hero think he's doing to the Spear Hero?

114
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,000
Have you no respect for the sanctity of a duel?!

115
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,800
Hurry up and admit defeat.

116
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,720
Do you want to be embarrassed even more, Mr. Hot Stuff?

117
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,930
Wh-Who would ever surrender now?

118
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,650
I see.

119
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,270
Then...

120
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,320
Shall I focus the attacks on your face and your crotch?

121
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,400
I'm a cowardly cheat, after all!

122
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,450
D-Don't!

123
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,460
Magic?

124
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,380
It was her!

125
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,090
You bitch!

126
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,390
Lightning Spear!

127
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,500
Victory is mine!

128
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,470
Hold it.

129
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,270
Someone interfered in our one-on-one duel.

130
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,020
It doesn't count.

131
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,190
Huh?

132
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,110
Your party member messed up that duel!

133
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,780
Sore loser much?

134
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,860
No!

135
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,280
Everyone there saw it!

136
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,070
You saw Myne use her magic, didn't you?

137
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,280
I know you saw it!

138
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,040
She used her magic to help him win...

139
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,750
No... There's no way they didn't see it.

140
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,260
There's no need to listen to the words of scum.

141
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,460
Spear Hero,

142
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,680
you are the victor!

143
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,260
I knew you could do it,

144
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,260
Motoyasu-sama.

145
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,100
Aww...

146
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,530
Shield Hero, I know you must feel terrible.

147
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,240
It's really too bad that you'll have to go back to fighting alone.

148
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,040
You were brilliant, Motoyasu-dono.

149
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,670
My daughter, Malty, was right to pick you.

150
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,090
Of course, Father.

151
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,260
I was so shocked when I heard Myne was a princess.

152
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,220
I am.

153
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,220
But I fight to contributeto the world's peace.

154
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,730
So these guys planned everything...

155
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,690
The daughter framed me to get in the good graces of her favorite hero.

156
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,740
And the father distorted the facts for the sake of his daughter.

157
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,700
This duel was a setup all along, too!

158
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,210
The Shield Hero has forced that girl to be his slave.

159
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,830
Please save her.

160
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,970
Do they want to see me suffer that badly?

161
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,050
I didn't come to this world because I wanted to.

162
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,890
You're the ones who summoned me!

163
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,810
So...

164
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,350
Why must I alone go through this?

165
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:40,780
The girl enslaved by the Shield Hero has been freed by the Spear Hero!

166
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,950
We should never have summoned the Shield Hero, anyway.

167
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,870
The other three are more than enough!

168
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,410
We should just get rid of that criminal scum at once.

169
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,290
Our country doesn't need the Shield!

170
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,080
Execute the Shield Hero right away!

171
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,790
It's all about the Shield again?

172
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,010
Is it because I'm the Shield Hero?

173
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,340
Damn it...

174
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,640
Damn it all!

175
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,180
God damn it...

176
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,730
Well, let's free the girl from her curse.

177
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,950
Raphtalia?

178
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,160
Begin.

179
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,620
Hey!

180
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,090
Slave pact with Raphtalia terminated

181
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,340
You're free now.

182
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,340
Be grateful for the charity Motoyasu-sama showed you.

183
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,980
Raphtalia...

184
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,740
That's it... I've had enough!

185
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,800
This is hell.

186
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,260
A world like this...

187
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
...can die for all I care!

188
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,730
Curse Series Requirement Met

189
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,020
You cheat!

190
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,730
Wh-What are you doing to Motoyasu-sama?

191
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,450
When did I ask you to free me?!

192
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,620
B-But he was abusing you, right?

193
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,540
What the hell do you know about Naofumi-sama?!

194
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,880
He never made me do anything I couldn't do!

195
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,550
He only activated the curse when I was too scared to fight!

196
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,380
And that's the problem!

197
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,260
Nobody should be forced to fight!

198
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,850
Naofumi-sama can't use any weapons!

199
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,720
Someone else has to fight for him!

200
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,390
It doesn't have to be you.

201
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,600
He'll just abuse you until you break.

202
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,230
Naofumi-sama defends me!

203
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,360
He lets me rest when I'm tired!

204
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,360
No, he's not that kind of guy.

205
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,740
Are you capable of extending a hand to a diseased slave on the verge of death?

206
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,000
Naofumi-sama fed me everything I wanted to eat!

207
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,750
He gave me valuable medicine to treat my illness!

208
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,460
Are you capable of that?!

209
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,380
O-Of course I could...

210
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,930
If that were true, you would have a slave by your side, too!

211
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,470
That's...

212
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,430
Knock it off!

213
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,310
How dare you, damned demi-human?

214
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,310
Look over there!

215
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,480
What's going on?

216
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,650
A quarrel?

217
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,360
Myne-san, I'd like to ask you about your illegal interference in the duel.

218
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,280
What ever do you mean?

219
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,570
Illegal interference?

220
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,330
You lost that duel, Motoyasu.

221
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,540
Someone shot a magic spell at Naofumi.

222
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,710
It was hard to tell, though, because it was wind magic.

223
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,750
Myne?

224
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,000
You must've imagined it.

225
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,550
The audience didn't see a thing.

226
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,630
The king has told them to keep quiet.

227
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,300
One look at the nobles' eyes makes it obvious.

228
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,520
I can't believe royalty would debase a sacred duel.

229
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,900
Naofumi-sama...

230
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,860
Why'd you come back?

231
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,160
To laugh at me?

232
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,830
I...

233
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,290
I don't need a traitor.

234
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,250
Get lost.

235
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,420
I heard rumors.

236
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,380
They called you the horrible hero who forced himself on a party member.

237
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,510
But I think you wouldn't do...

238
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,890
I didn't do it!

239
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,180
Naofumi-sama...

240
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,060
Stay away!

241
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,180
Please listen to me.

242
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,190
Don't touch me!

243
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,820
Thanks to the oh-so-charitable Motoyasu, you're free now.

244
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,650
You can stay clear of me!

245
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,830
Or what, did he tell you to go get a good look at the loser's face?

246
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,830
Please just leave me alone.

247
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,180
I believe you, Naofumi-sama.

248
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,890
What can I do to make you believe me?

249
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,760
"Believe you"?

250
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,480
After you betrayed me?

251
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,650
I will always be on your side,come what may!

252
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,650
Lies!

253
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,440
You're just saying that to trick me again!

254
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,610
I...

255
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,440
Shut up!

256
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,740
What else are you people going to frame me for?

257
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,990
I drew the short straw the moment I came here.

258
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,290
Try as I might, nobody will accept me.

259
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,870
Nobody believes me.

260
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,880
Because of this damn thing, I...

261
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,340
Damn it!

262
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,010
This shield has saved my life many times over.

263
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,680
And during the Wave...

264
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,600
Even though you couldn't fight,

265
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,730
you defended the villagers using it.

266
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,480
I didn't really do it for the villagers.

267
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,530
Still, you saved many, many lives.

268
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,700
I'm not that nice a guy.

269
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,490
I saw you as nothing but a tool at first, too.

270
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,700
But you saved me.

271
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,960
No!

272
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,080
I was only thinking of myself...

273
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,810
I know you better than anyone else in this world.

274
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,100
I know how kind you are.

275
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,520
So even if the whole world speaks ill of you,

276
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,530
I'll tell them they're wrong.

277
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,780
I'll tell them again and again that you're a wonderful person.

278
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,740
You're the one who saved my life, gave me a sword,

279
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,990
and showed me my purpose in life.

280
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,960
I am your sword.

281
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,050
I will follow you through fire and brimstone.

282
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,930
Those were the words I always wished someone would say to me.

283
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,510
No, I just didn't hear her before...

284
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,180
I am your sword!

285
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,690
Wherever you go, I will go with you.

286
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,370
Even if you can't trust anyone anymore, I trust you.

287
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,950
I trust you, the man who saved me.

288
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,490
No, I trust...

289
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,500
...the great Shield Hero.

290
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,300
Wh-Who are you?

291
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,510
What are you saying?

292
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,810
It's me, Raphtalia.

293
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,060
But... Raphtalia's still a kid.

294
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,560
Sheesh...

295
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,480
When will you stop treating me like a child?

296
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,900
I mean, sure, I'm still an unreliable kid who cries at the drop of a hat.

297
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,820
I may even be a burden.

298
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,450
But please let me stand by your side.

299
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,790
I need you, Naofumi-sama.

300
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,680
I didn't do anything wrong!

301
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,050
What's wrong is a hero having a slave!

302
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:41,110
Raphtalia-chan might still be doing all this because she's brainwashed.

303
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,690
I don't know about that.

304
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:48,110
It's amazing that you can say that after seeing them like this.

305
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,320
It must've been so painful.

306
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,330
But from now, let me share in your pain.

307
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,610
Good morning, Naofumi-sama.

308
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,610
Did you make this?

309
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,850
Yeah!

310
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,140
It's only leftovers from the castle kitchen and some bread, though.

311
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,790
You are Raphtalia, right?

312
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,940
I'm not used to it yet.

313
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,610
When demi-humans level up as children,

314
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,270
their bodies follow suit and grow rapidly, too.

315
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:55,330
That's why demi-humans are seen as inhuman beasts and discriminated against.

316
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,970
I see.

317
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,490
For leftovers, it's quite good!

318
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,990
Naofumi-sama?

319
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,780
I can taste it. It's good!

320
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,630
Let's eat lots of delicious food from now on.

321
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,030
Naofumi-sama...

322
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,810
Yeah?

323
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,850
Let's do our best.

324
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,970
Filo
