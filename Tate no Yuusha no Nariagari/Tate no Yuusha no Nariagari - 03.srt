1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,480
Wait!

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,330
It's been a week since the battle in the coal pit,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,200
Get back here!

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,510
and my shield's gained so manyskills and abilities I lost count of them all.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,660
Animal Needle Shield

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,270
But I still let my guard down and got hurt.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,380
Naofumi-sama!

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,430
Shield Prison!

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,110
The Wave is almost here.

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,520
It's about time we upgraded our equipment.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,920
Naofumi-sama!

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,940
I did it!

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,340
The Rising of the Shield Hero

14
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,790
Wave of Catastrophe

15
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,510
Wow, I hardly recognized you!

16
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,570
You've turned into a real pretty lady.

17
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,870
I haven't seen you in a while.

18
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,080
What've you been up to?

19
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,890
I had the innkeeper teach me table manners.

20
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,520
I want to eat my food properly,like Naofumi-sama does.

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,840
That so?

22
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,670
You've grown so much.

23
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,590
Nothing like the pipsqueak you used to be.

24
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,050
You think?

25
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,850
Huh?

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,020
Someone's hard to please.

27
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,450
I'm actually quite shocked, too.

28
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,230
This country is full of lolicons.

29
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,980
Wow, Miss. You're adorable.

30
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,770
Have another one on the house.

31
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,960
I can understand finding little girls cute, but...

32
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,640
Take this, too.

33
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,150
Uh...

34
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,860
You people take it too far.

35
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,920
Say, kid.

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,760
Don't you know what demi-humans are like?

37
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,750
Boss!

38
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,180
Forget that!

39
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,060
We're here to buy armor for Naofumi-sama!

40
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,390
Do you have any recommendations?

41
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,730
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,460
We're here for your equipment.

43
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,890
I appreciate the thought,

44
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,520
but think about yourself first!

45
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,740
Did you forget how you just got hurt in the plains?

46
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,220
No, but you need a weapon...

47
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,250
Naofumi-sama...

48
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,040
You'd best stop messing around,

49
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,990
or you will die.

50
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,460
Boss! This sword seems really sharp!

51
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,960
It's magic iron.

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,590
Wanna try it out?

53
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,410
Will you give us a discount?

54
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,600
Anything for you, miss.

55
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,900
Thank you so much!

56
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,710
While we're at it, could you show us some armor, too?

57
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,010
Of course.

58
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,850
She stands up for herself now...

59
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,160
Or maybe she's just rude...

60
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,880
Our budget is around 180 silvers.

61
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,110
In that case...

62
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,820
How about this?

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,850
I don't think it's my style...

64
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,500
Hmm...

65
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,280
Yeah, it will strip Naofumi-sama of all his individuality.

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,410
Then I can whip up something made to order.

67
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,860
Made to order?!

68
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,590
Yeah.

69
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,870
If you don't mind me using materialsI've got on hand, I can finish by tomorrow...

70
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,830
Please do!

71
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,120
It was so nice of him to give us adiscount on that sword, huh?

72
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,250
Yeah.

73
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,470
He's a really nice guy.

74
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm not so sure...

75
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,000
That wasn't me!

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,150
It was me.

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,910
Are you ready to order?

78
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,690
I'll get the cheapest lunch set you have,

79
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,420
and she'll have the kids' lunch.

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,300
Naofumi-sama! I'm not a kid anymore!

81
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,670
I'll get the cheapest lunch set, too!

82
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,790
R-Right away.

83
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,430
You really don't need to force yourself to act grown-up.

84
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,620
I'm not forcing it!

85
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,630
Doesn't this make me look like a typical villain?

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,300
So cool...

87
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,000
It suits you perfectly! You look great!

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,840
I call it the Barbarian Armor!

89
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:37,480
Barbarian Armor

90
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,550
You're rocking it, kid.

91
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,930
You look like a real bandit.

92
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,470
I'm supposed to be a hero, you know.

93
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,990
You look so dashing!

94
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,020
Well, you did make it for me.

95
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,990
It'd be a shame not to wear it.

96
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,940
The whole town is on edge now.

97
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,170
The Wave is nearly here, after all.

98
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,610
If only I knew when and where it'll start,

99
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,390
I could come up with a plan.

100
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,840
Huh? Has nobody told you?

101
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,190
You know that church you can see from the town square?

102
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,080
There's a huge hourglass inside.

103
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,660
When the last grain of sand in it falls, the heroes and their parties

104
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,410
will be sent to where the Wave begins, or so I hear.

105
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,380
Come this way.

106
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,340
Is this the dragon hourglass the king was talking about?

107
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,650
It's counting down to the Wave?

108
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,870
Is that Naofumi I see?

109
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,860
Dude, come on.

110
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,310
You're still fighting with such flimsy equipment?

111
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,440
Who are they, Naofumi-sama?

112
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,820
Hey! Motoyasu-sama's talking to you!

113
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,890
Hello.

114
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,110
I'm Kitamura Motoyasu, the Spear Hero.

115
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,090
Y-You're a hero?

116
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,480
So cute!

117
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,150
Motoyasu-sama, why are you complimenting a filthy demi-human?

118
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,140
A girl as adorable as you shouldn't wield a sword.

119
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,010
I'll protect you.

120
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,910
I'm sorry!

121
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,810
I've sworn to fight with Naofumi-sama!

122
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,140
With Naofumi?

123
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,800
You can't.

124
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,100
If you stay with him, you'll be in dangerâ€”

125
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,740
What?

126
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,670
Am I not right?

127
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,220
We're leaving!

128
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,610
Surely you've heard the rumors about him, too.

129
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,050
Rumors?

130
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,810
See you at the Wave.

131
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,810
Don't hold us back.

132
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,570
U-Um...

133
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,740
What?

134
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,490
Did something happen between you and the other heroes?

135
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,460
That's none of your business.

136
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,750
Naofumi-sama,

137
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,580
I...

138
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,590
I'll go ahead and turn in.

139
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,970
Good night.

140
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,430
Even when I tell the truth,

141
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,150
nobody believes me, anyway.

142
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,900
The Day of the Wave of Catastrophe

143
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,860
Naofumi-sama...

144
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,380
What's up?

145
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,540
Well, I just want to say...

146
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,420
I'm truly grateful I met you.

147
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,940
You cured my illness and fed me warm meals.

148
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,710
You taught me how to live.

149
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,310
Your parents won't ever come back.

150
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,040
But we can prevent other kids from going through what you did.

151
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,660
And you gave me a reason to fight...

152
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,460
A reason to fight the Waves.

153
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,490
I am your sword!

154
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,910
Wherever you go, I will go with you.

155
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,170
That so?

156
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,270
Where are we?

157
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,240
There it is.

158
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,410
The Wave of Catastrophe.

159
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,420
Those guys... Raphtalia, we're going!

160
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,940
Look there, Naofumi-sama!

161
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,430
It's the village of Lute!

162
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,160
Have the villagers evacuated?

163
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,410
A flare?

164
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,330
They think their job's done once they letthe knights know where they are?

165
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,940
The castle isn't far away, but by the time the knights get here,

166
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,460
the village will be wiped out!

167
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,120
We're going!

168
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,020
To Lute Village!

169
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,630
Right!

170
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,560
Are you all right?

171
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,950
Raphtalia, go help the villagers evacuate.

172
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,130
But what about you?

173
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,910
I'll...

174
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,990
I'll lure the enemy away.

175
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,290
One of the heroes!

176
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,320
The Shield Hero is here for us!

177
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,540
Listen up!

178
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,120
I'll keep them occupied!

179
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,510
Get out of here while you can!

180
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,430
H-Help me!

181
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,940
Air Strike Shield!

182
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,980
Hurry up and run!

183
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,610
Mom!

184
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,350
Shield Prison!

185
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,730
Mom!

186
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,520
Damn it!

187
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,120
This way, you stupid zombies!

188
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,670
Keep up with me if you can!

189
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,920
Why am I risking my life to defend total strangers?

190
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,030
I'm such a fool.

191
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,730
Come this way, everyone!

192
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,710
Hurry!

193
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,010
There's way too many of them.

194
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,540
How can I minimize the damage to the village?

195
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,100
Air Strike Shield!

196
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,000
S-Stay away!

197
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,320
Damn it! Stay away!

198
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,020
No... Stop!

199
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,310
Shit!

200
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,510
It's showing no signs of slowing down.

201
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,270
What are those guys doing?

202
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,650
Hurry up and...

203
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,220
Did I get them?

204
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,910
Sir Hero!

205
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,410
Why'd you come back here?

206
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,120
We all changed our minds after seeing how courageously you're fighting.

207
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,910
This village is our home.

208
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,420
We cannot run away and abandon it.

209
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,220
We'll fight with you.

210
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,600
Got it.

211
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,210
Help me keep the enemy pinned down until the evacuation's complete.

212
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,820
Die, monster!

213
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,600
You guys can't deal with this one!Fall back!

214
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,480
But...

215
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,290
Think about your families!

216
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,480
Don't die here for no reason!

217
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,200
Naofumi-sama!

218
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,370
Raphtalia!

219
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,000
Take care of it!

220
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,920
Well done.

221
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,790
A-Amazing.

222
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,890
We'll handle things here. Hurry up and evacuate.

223
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,970
Got it.

224
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,930
Please be safe.

225
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,550
Well, then...

226
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,190
The enemy's numbers aren't going down.

227
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,290
What now?

228
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,020
What's that?

229
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,280
Raphtalia!

230
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,770
We burned them all to death at once.

231
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,970
The Shield Hero?

232
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,620
You're quite tough.

233
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,430
Tch. They didn't care that we were here?

234
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,150
Did you do this knowing Naofumi-sama was here?

235
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,200
Depending on your answer, I'll have your head!

236
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,610
Draw your swords.

237
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,320
Are you with the Shield Hero?

238
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,370
I am Naofumi-sama's sword.

239
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,080
None may disrespect him in my presence.

240
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,510
You think you can point your blade at the royal knights, you damned demi-human?

241
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,370
What kind of knight neglects the people he's meant to defend?

242
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,690
Forget it, Raphtalia.

243
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,120
But...

244
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,010
Drop it.

245
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,710
That's right.

246
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,480
So long as you behave yourself,

247
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,760
we won't be forced to make any mistakes.

248
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,970
I guess.

249
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,130
I could sit tight and watch you morons become monster feed.

250
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,650
That doesn't sound too bad!

251
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,620
D-Don't falter! Get in formation...

252
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,770
Want to die an honorable death in battle?

253
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,700
Raphtalia!

254
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,560
Coming!

255
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,510
Listen here! We'll buy you time!

256
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,480
Use it to get in formation!

257
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,220
Let's go, Raphtalia.

258
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,010
Right!

259
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,570
Let the Shield handle this.

260
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,180
We're heading to where the Three Heroes are!

261
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,500
Now!

262
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,340
Support the Shield Hero!Phalanx formation!

263
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,350
Phalanx!

264
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,250
Charge!

265
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,600
Naofumi-sama, look at the knights.

266
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,330
Forget them. Let's go.

267
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,650
Wind Arrow!

268
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,430
Crimson Blade!

269
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,600
I'll end this!

270
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,560
Take this!

271
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,810
Lightning Spear!

272
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,590
Naofumi-sama... Look at the sky.

273
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,090
Walk in the park.

274
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,380
This boss was a piece of cake.

275
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,540
Indeed. The next Wave will probably be easy, too.

276
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,260
By the way, where's Naofumi?

277
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,370
It's good that he wasn't here.

278
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,620
He'd just hold us back.

279
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,590
Obviously!

280
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,220
Heroes!

281
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,470
Well done!

282
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,190
The knights, huh?

283
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,410
It's a bit late to show up now.

284
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,070
Right?

285
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,910
Now, now, don't say that.

286
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,910
His Highness has rewards for each of you.

287
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,260
Let us go see him.

288
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,310
Naofumi-sama...

289
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,190
I killed all the monsters left in the village.

290
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,370
I see.

291
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,760
Did we...

292
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,390
...win?

293
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,970
Sir Hero...

294
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,460
Thank you so much.

295
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,290
We couldn't have made it without you.

296
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,330
Thank your lucky stars, not me.

297
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,760
No.

298
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,840
Your presence is what helped us survive.

299
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,230
We'll never forget what you've done for us.

300
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,610
Whatever.

301
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,780
They looked truly grateful.

302
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,730
I guess.

303
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:19,270
We prevented at least a few kids from going through what I did, right?

304
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,700
Yeah.

305
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,650
I...

306
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,650
You did well.

307
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,710
I killed lots of monsters.

308
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,630
Yeah.

309
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,970
Lullaby at Dawn
