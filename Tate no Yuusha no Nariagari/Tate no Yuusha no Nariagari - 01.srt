1
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,830
What a weird dream.

2
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,040
My name is Iwatani Naofumi.

3
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,670
I'm a somewhat otaku-leaning second-year college student.

4
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,550
Sunny day, huh?

5
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,510
When my kid brother started breaking bad, I brought him back in line,

6
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,980
and so I had the privilege of living at home, allowance included.

7
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,020
With no need to work part-time,I got to enjoy an idyllic otaku life.

8
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,620
That said, I certainly wasn't one of your so-called shut-ins.

9
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,370
When I'd run out of money to spend,

10
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,370
I'd go to the library to browse through my light novels.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,250
I was a completely run-of-the-mill otaku leading a completely ordinary life.

12
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,590
Ow!

13
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,170
What the hell, man?

14
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,760
But it all changed when I picked up this book.

15
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,810
The Records of the Four Cardinal Weapons

16
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,680
"The Records of the Four Cardinal Weapons"?

17
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,060
The Waves of Apocalyptic Catastrophe

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,640
"The Waves of Apocalyptic Catastrophe...

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,020
To save the world from them, four heroes will be summoned from another world."

20
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,980
How very like an LN.

21
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,950
"Each of the four heroes

22
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,030
wield a characteristic weapon: a sword, a spear, a bow, or a shield."

23
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,790
Uh, I'm pretty sure a shield is more like armor than a weapon.

24
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,500
And where's the heroine, anyway?

25
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,750
I don't think it's this princess. She seems kinda slutty.

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,880
Huh... Each of the heroes seems impressive and pretty damn cool.

27
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,010
I guess all four of them are the protagonists.

28
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,050
The sword, spear, and bow heroes all get spotlights,

29
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,760
and even the shield hero gets focus...

30
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,820
What the heck?

31
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,180
We did it! The summoning was a success!

32
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,870
Where am I?

33
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,960
O brave heroes, please save our world!

34
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,080
Excuse me?

35
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,000
Who are these guys?

36
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,460
And where am I, anyway?

37
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,970
The hell is this?

38
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,470
A shield?

39
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,970
The Rising of the Shield Hero

40
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,400
The Shield Hero

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,650
O brave heroes, please save our world!

42
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,610
Seriously?

43
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,650
What do you mean by that?

44
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,110
There is a long and complicated story behind this,

45
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:48,040
but we've summoned you Four Cardinal Heroes here using an ancient ritual.

46
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,000
"Four Cardinal"? So he thinks the four of us are heroes of legend?

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,590
Our world teeters on the brink of destruction.

48
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,010
We beg you, O brave heroes! Please help us!

49
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,930
I guess I could hear you out, at least.

50
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,510
I refuse.

51
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,600
Likewise.

52
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,140
We can go back to our world, right?

53
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,480
We'll talk about your problems after that.

54
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,110
Don't you guys feel any guilt at all for bringing us here without our consent?

55
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,240
And if you throw us out as soon as peace is restored, we'd have worked for nothing.

56
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,700
How willing are you to accommodate us?

57
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,580
Depending on your answer, we might end up becoming your enemies instead.

58
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,250
Not only are these guys taking all this in stride,

59
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,960
they've already started to demand respect and rewards!

60
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,840
F-First, we'd like you to have an audience with the king of our country, Melromarc.

61
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,470
You can negotiate your reward after that, so please...

62
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,510
Fine, I guess.

63
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,180
I suppose we could consider their offer.

64
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,480
Not like our demands are gonna change, no matter who we talk to.

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,150
Yeesh! Could these guys be any more confident?

66
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,950
We really are in another world, huh?

67
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,360
We sure are.

68
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,830
Such a pleasant breeze...

69
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,830
It's like the typical sales pitch in all those tour brochures.

70
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,670
Wait, have you never traveled out of Japan before?

71
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,830
Going by the breeze outside,

72
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,300
this place probably has your standard Mediterranean climate.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,260
Yeah, yeah. Excuse me for my lack of knowledge and vocabulary.

74
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,940
So these men are the Four Cardinal Heroes of ancient legend?

75
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,650
I am the king of Melromarc, Aultcray Melromarc XXXII.

76
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,820
Heroes,

77
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,410
name yourselves.

78
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,740
Amaki Ren, sixteen years old, high schooler.

79
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm Kitamura Motoyasu. Twenty-one, and a college student.

80
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,210
I suppose I'm up next.

81
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,840
Kawasumi Itsuki, seventeen years old, and a high schooler.

82
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,260
And lastly, me. I'm...

83
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,800
I see.

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,090
Ren, Motoyasu, and Itsuki, huh?

85
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,640
Y-Yo, King, aren't you forgetting me?

86
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,100
Hmm? Oh, forgive me.

87
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,640
"Yo, King"? You mustn't be so disrespectful.

88
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,600
Should I call him His Highness, then?

89
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,190
That's too formal, no?

90
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,770
"King" is fine.

91
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,690
Well, whatever works.

92
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,740
My name is Iwatani Naofumi. I'm twenty, and a college student.

93
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,740
Now...

94
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,790
I suppose I owe you an explanation.

95
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,910
You're ignoring me?

96
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:43,170
My country, Melromarc, and the entire world is headed toward destruction.

97
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:49,130
I'm still pissed off at how the king's treating me, but here's the long story short.

98
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,050
This world has an apocalyptic prophecy,

99
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,140
which mentions "Waves" that will lead the world to ruin

100
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,770
and reportedly appear in, well, several waves.

101
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,440
Unless the calamities wrought by the Waves are thwarted,

102
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,360
the world will end.

103
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,360
Each country here has an ancient dragon hourglass

104
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,330
which can predict the arrival of the Waves.

105
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,870
The first Wave washed over this country before we were summoned.

106
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:25,290
Local knights and traveling adventurers somehow managed to fend it off,

107
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,760
but the following Waves will be even more potent.

108
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,510
The hourglass's sands will keep trickling as long as the Waves keep coming...

109
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,850
Currently, less than a month remains until the second Wave.

110
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,150
We underestimated the prophesied Waves.

111
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,110
We realized once we actually experienced one

112
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,240
that only the Four Cardinal Heroes could counter them.

113
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,700
And so, we followed the legend and summoned you four.

114
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,530
We have no time to lose!

115
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,160
Wait a sec.

116
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,580
The Records of the Four Cardinal Weapons

117
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,120
Isn't this the exact same story as the one in that book?

118
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,170
We get the gist of it now.

119
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,920
Anyway, surely you didn't summon us expecting us to save you for free.

120
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,470
Of course, once you repel all the Waves,

121
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,510
we shall reward you handsomely.

122
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,760
Will you, now? Well, as long as we have your word.

123
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,430
We'll work with you provided you don't turn on us.

124
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,590
But don't think for a moment that you can tame us.

125
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,770
Exactly. We can't have you looking down on us.

126
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,020
R-Right...

127
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,400
God, these guys are so high-and-mighty.

128
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,150
I trust we have an agreement.

129
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,370
Then, heroes, you should all check your statuses.

130
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,290
Wait, what's a status?

131
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,040
Uh...

132
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,210
What's wrong with you guys?

133
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,670
It should've been the first thing you noticed in this world.

134
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,840
Oh, get over yourself! Quit acting like you know everything!

135
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,050
Don't you see an icon in the corner of your field of vision?

136
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,800
Huh?

137
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,180
You're right. There it is.

138
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,850
Try focusing on it.

139
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,230
Like this?

That's worrying.

146
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,490
Yeah. No telling if we can fight like this.

147
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,740
What's all this, anyway?

148
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,620
Status Magic, an ability exclusive to the heroes.

149
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,490
So what are we supposed to do?

150
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,120
You must leave on an adventure

151
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,250
to develop and upgrade the legendary weapons that you have equipped.

152
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,670
They aren't maxed out of the box?

153
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,300
Wait, mine isn't even a weapon.

154
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,550
Couldn't we just wield other weapons until these are usable?

155
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,600
We can figure that out as we go.

156
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,020
Anyway, it looks like we ought to train ourselves.

157
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,270
We'll have to level up as much as we can.

158
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,610
Then if the four of us form a party...

159
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,480
One moment, heroes.

160
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,490
You will each recruit and adventure separately.

161
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,950
And why is that?

162
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:07,080
It is said that the legendary weapons repel one another by nature.

163
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:11,630
When two more wielders of the legendary weapons operate together, it causes an adverse reaction in the weapons. Working separately is highly advised.

164
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,290
If you work together, it apparently hinders their development.

165
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,920
He's telling the truth, huh?

166
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,220
And the weapons are translating all verbal and visual information into Japanese for us.

167
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,470
The sun is about to set.

168
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,810
Rest up tonight, and set forth tomorrow.

169
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,230
In the meantime, we'll gather the best of the best to form your parties.

170
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,480
We've prepared rooms for you.

171
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,400
Please come this way.

172
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,650
I hear the Four Cardinal Heroes have been summoned.

173
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,040
All four of them, in this country?

174
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,950
Are they sure about this?

175
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,620
Wait, that means the Shield Hero is also...

176
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,080
I guess you get special treatment when you're heroes of legend.

177
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,830
The girl who showed us here was a cutie pie, too.

178
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,340
And our dinner was sumptuous, though it did taste unusual.

179
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,090
Small Shield

180
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,090
ATT: 0MAG: 0P. DEF: +6M. DEF: +4DEX:  0

181
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,090
P.DEF +3

182
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,090
Fire: 0Water: 0Ice: 0Wind: 0Earth: 0Lightning: 0Light: 0Dark: 0

183
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,460
Hey, isn't this kinda like a game?

184
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,090
HeatUnlock Requirements:None

185
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,470
You mean it is one.

186
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,800
It's exactly like Emerald Online.

187
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,600
Huh? What's that game?

188
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,060
Are you serious? It's super famous!

189
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,930
What are you talking about?

190
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,560
This isn't some online game. It's a world out of a console game.

191
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,400
It's called Dimension Web.

192
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,150
You're wrong. It's a VRMMO.

193
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,990
It's pretty much the exact same as Brave Star Online.

194
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,450
Let's sort out the information we have.

195
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,620
Ren, can we take "VRMMO" literally?

196
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,580
Yeah.

197
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,200
You guys get what means too, right?

198
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
I think a sci-fi game I'm familiar with explored the concept.

199
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,040
I've read about them in LNs, yeah.

200
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,210
Just to be sure, let's check our general knowledge.

201
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,410
Who's the person on the thousand yen bill?

202
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,010
One, two...

203
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,840
Yawara Gotaro.

204
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,840
Yuda Masato.

205
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,840
Kodaka Enichi.

206
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,840
Noguchi Hideyo.

207
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Who?!

208
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,470
What won Buzzword of the Year last year?!

209
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,390
Your favorite voice actors?

210
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,140
Which countries won World War II?

211
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,680
Who's the Prime Minister?

212
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,070
It seems we're all from different versions of Japan.

213
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,990
Looks like it. They sound nothing alike.

214
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,490
So there are parallel world Japans out there too, huh?

215
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,780
I thought we might just be from different eras,

216
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,620
but I guess not, if they're so different.

217
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,710
And I can't believe all three of you played games that are just like this world.

218
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,670
Why am I the only one unfamiliar with this stuff?

219
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,300
Huh? What is it?

220
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,840
W-Well, I just thought it might because you're the Shield Hero.

221
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,180
Oh, you too?

222
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,510
It's only natural.

223
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,640
Wh-What're you guys talking about?Is there something wrong with the shield?

224
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,440
All right. Big Bro Motoyasu's gonna get you up to speed on the basics.

225
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,520
As far as I know, the Shielder,

226
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,020
the class that specializes in the shield...

227
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,980
Yeah?

228
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,700
...is one for losers. No high-level gamers play it.

229
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,040
No!

230
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,280
How about in your worlds?

231
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,740
Sorry.

232
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,540
Likewise.

233
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,380
How's the terrain here?

234
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,470
Very similar to what I'm familiar with.

235
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,300
Each weapon has its own ideal hunting ground, so let's spread out.

236
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,300
Well, whatever.

237
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,930
If I'm weak, I can just rely on my party.

238
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,560
It might have girls and all, too.

239
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,610
The shield's role would be to thwart enemy attacks and defend the party, right?

240
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,320
And while my life back home was devoid of romance, I might just meet The One here.

241
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,610
It'll be fine. I've been summoned to another world, after all.

242
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,330
Even if I'm weak, things will work out.

243
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,540
All right! I'm gonna give it my all!

244
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,250
R-Right.

245
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,040
We have to set out on adventures tomorrow.

246
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,790
Let's head back to our rooms and get a good night's sleep.

247
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,920
Do you think they have baths here?

248
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,760
It's quite likely you'll have to go outdoors.

249
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,920
That's right.

250
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,010
My grand adventure begins tomorrow!

251
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:12,030
We have gathered brave warriors who will fight the Waves with you legendary heroes.

252
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,160
These people will join our parties, huh?

253
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,000
Wow, there's a real looker here, too.

254
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,590
Now, our future champions!

255
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,050
Time to begin your journey!

256
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,100
What? They're the ones choosing?!

257
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,860
Three... four... five...

258
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,110
Yo, King!

259
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,320
I have to admit, I wasn't expecting this.

260
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,370
No volunteers? He must have no charisma.

261
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,580
So there have been rumors.

262
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,660
Did something happen?

263
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:04,960
Well, rumors that the Shield Hero is ignorant of this world have spread around town.

264
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,010
What?

265
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,380
Legend says the heroes come with a firm understanding of our lands.

266
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,600
And they seem to think he doesn't meet that criteria.

267
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,890
Maybe someone was eavesdropping on our chat last night.

268
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,810
Seriously?

269
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,100
Just for that?

270
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,690
Sure, I may not know much, but...

271
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,820
That aside, Ren, you don't need five!Gimme some of them!

272
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,570
I'm actually more of a loner.

273
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,570
If any of you can't cut it, I'll leave you behind.

274
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,700
What do you make of this, Motoyasu? Don't you think it's unfair?

275
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,950
I'm actually surprised that my party is all girls, too.

276
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,000
It pisses me off that he doesn't seem all that broken up about it.

277
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,460
It would be best to split them three each,

278
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,510
but if we force it, it could destroy morale.

279
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,800
So, what, you're telling me to go it alone?!

280
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,930
I'm a Shielder, you know!

281
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,470
The class you guys said was for losers!

282
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,930
How am I supposed to grow stronger without a party?

283
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,900
Sir Hero!

284
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,940
It's that girl.

285
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,360
Would you allow me to join the Shield Hero?

286
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,490
Are you sure?

287
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,450
Yes!

288
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,830
F-For real?

289
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,410
She'll join my party?

290
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:27,000
Are there any others who wouldn't mind joining Naofumi-dono?

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,090
I suppose we'll have to take other measures.

292
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,760
Naofumi-dono, you will have to recruit for your party yourself.

293
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,100
A-All right.

294
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,810
Every month, we shall provide each hero with the funds they require.

295
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,440
This time, Naofumi-dono's payment will be higher than the others.

296
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,190
Here are your initial war chests. Please accept them.

297
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,280
Naofumi-sama gets 800 silver coins.

298
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,330
The others get 600.

299
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,580
Use this to procure all necessary equipment and set forth on your journey.

300
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Yes, sir!

301
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,710
Later, Naofumi.

302
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,970
Take good care of her, you hear me?

303
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:18,100
It's sad that we can't help you, but good luck with your recruiting.

304
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,350
See you again when the time comes.

305
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,730
Y-Yeah.

306
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,060
Um, Shield Hero.

307
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,820
My name is Myne Suphia. It is an honor to fight with you.

308
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,740
I'm Iwatani Naofumi. Nice to meet you.

309
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,860
My pleasure!

310
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,280
She's so open and friendly.

311
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,410
And she chose to join me when no one else would.

312
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,910
I've gotta keep her safe, no matter what!

313
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,540
Shall we get going, uh, Myne-san?

314
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,630
Yes, Sir Hero.

315
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,430
Let me show you around the castle town to start off.

316
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,600
I caught a glimpse last night,

317
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,310
but taking a closer look really drives it home that this is another world.

318
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,190
What shall we do now, Sir Hero?

319
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,520
Hmm, let's see...

320
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,360
I'd like to check out a shop that sells weapons and armor first.

321
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,200
That makes sense.

322
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,490
With that much money, you can buy some fine equipment.

323
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,790
I'll take you to a shop I trust, then.

324
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,500
Yeah, please do.

325
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,660
Sure thing! Follow me!

326
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,790
So cute.

327
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,920
Nothing beats having a girl in your party, huh?

328
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,630
I wholeheartedly recommend this place.

329
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,850
So this is what a weapons shop is like.

330
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,680
Welcome.

331
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,190
Is this your first time in a weapons shop?You sure know how to pick 'em.

332
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,690
Actually, she brought me here.

333
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,070
Have we met before, Miss? Why do you look so familiar?

334
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,530
I've come shopping here before.

335
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,860
Your shop is quite famous, you know.

336
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,080
Ain't that nice of ya.

337
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,700
By the way, who's your companion with the funny outfit?

338
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,420
Can't you tell, boss?

339
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,290
You mean you're one of the heroes?

340
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,550
Ah, I see you've got a shield. You must be the dud.

341
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,010
Why are rumors about me spreading like wildfire?

342
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,640
Whatever. I can't let it get me down.

343
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,440
I'm Iwatani Naofumi, the Shield Hero.

344
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,150
Pleased to meet you!

345
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,810
Naofumi, eh?

346
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,650
Well, if you'll be a regular, I don't give two hoots if you wield a shield or what.

347
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,240
Nice to meet ya, kid!

348
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,490
Anyway, boss,

349
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,240
could you provide Sir Hero with the equipment he needs?

350
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,200
Our budget is, let's see... Around 250 silvers.

351
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,790
Left to right, that's iron, magic iron,

352
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,960
magic steel, and silver iron in ascending order of cost.

353
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,920
I guarantee they're all quality swords, though.

354
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,220
Wow. With one of these, even I could...

355
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,430
What the...

356
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,930
Seriously, what's going on?

357
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,230
I don't get it, either.

358
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,610
It looked like it just flew out of your hand.

359
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,520
What?

360
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,240
Legendary Weapon Rule Violation:Holding non-assigned weapon

361
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,740
"Rule Violation"?

362
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,030
A hero may not hold, with intent to fight,any weapon other than their assigned legendary weapon

363
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,030
What the hell?

364
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
How am I supposed to fight with just a shield?

365
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,500
Well, looks like I can't use any weapons other than this shield.

366
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,410
How does that work?

367
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,800
It looks like any other small shield at first glance.

368
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,380
Doesn't this thing come off?

369
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,470
I can move it around, but I can't seem to remove it from my body.

370
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,350
That's so weird.

371
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,850
I sense a great amount of power in this thing,

372
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,690
but even my appraisal magic isn't telling me much.

373
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,140
Right...

374
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,690
Well, thanks for showing me something interesting.

375
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,940
Want to buy some armor instead?

376
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,780
Oh, hey.

377
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,660
You're starting to look the part now.

378
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,030
Thanks.

379
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,990
Chain Mail

380

384
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,040
How much is it?

385
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,830
I'll give you a discount. 120 silvers.

386
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,370
How much would you buy it for?

387
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,000
Huh? Well, if it's mostly new, I'd pay 100 silvers.

388
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,130
Why do you ask?

389
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,430
When you grow stronger, you won't need it anymore.

390
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,100
That's why I asked him how much we could sell it back for.

391
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,680
Makes sense.

392
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,430
All right. We'll take it.

393
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,600
Thanks! I'll throw in some innerwear to show my gratitude!

394
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,730
Shall we head off to battle now, Sir Hero?

395
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,690
Y-Yeah!

396
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,650
Time to level up, huh?

397
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,900
My adventure's finally beginning!

398
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,850
Wow. There's no limit to how much it can absorb.

399
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,930
Absorbed Orange Balloon x1

400
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,060
This must be the power of a legendary weapon.

401
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,690
Yeah.

402
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,070
This must be why I don't feel pain when I'm bitten, too.

403
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,990
Looks like I need a lot more fodder before I can upgrade it to a different shield.

404
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,620
I see.

405
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,080
By the way, can we sell these orange balloon fragments?

406
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,370
Yes, but only for one copper coin at most.

407
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,010
Looking at how Ren destroyed them, they must be really weak monsters.

408
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,170
I guess that's all they're worth.

409
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,800
That should be enough shield fodder.

410
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,850
It should evolve as I level up, too.

411
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,810
Let's call it a day and head back to the weapons shop.

412
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:43,150
If we buy me some new equipment, we can go that much farther tomorrow.

413
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,230
Fair enough.

414
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,950
Equipment for the lady, huh?

415
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,700
Sure, you'll be much stronger with good equipment.

416
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,530
Right?

417
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,910
This might get expensive, so I should start haggling now.

418
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,170
I see our hero is a real comedian.

419
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,500
Eighty percent off.

420
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,090
Are you stupid? Twenty percent extra!

421
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,760
Wh-Why's it going up?Eighty-nine percent off!

422
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,050
Anyone who tries to haggle without even seeing the goods deserves to pay double!

423
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,550
Keep talking! Ninety percent off!

424
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,810
Twenty-nine percent extra!

425
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,390
Seriously, stop raising the price!One hundred percent off!

426
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,350
That's just free, kid!

427
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,350
Free's fine by me!

428
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,900
Hup.

429
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,820
Boss, how much is that in total?At sixty percent off.

430
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,820
Four hundred and eighty silvers with a discount. I can't go any lower.

431
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,120
Uh, that'll leave us with 200 silvers...

432
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,620
Myne, can you downgrade a bit?

433
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,750
I don't know how much we'll have to spend on inns and other living expenses yet.

434
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,790
It'll be fine, Sir Hero.

435
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,920
The stronger I am, the more loot we'll get from monsters.

436
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,300
That should keep us going.

437
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,180
There's the otherworld trope I've been waiting for!

438
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,890
F-Fine, I guess.

439
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,560
All right. We'll take these, boss.

440
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,930
Thanks a ton!

441
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,810
I see our hero's got a real nose for good deals.

442
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,110
Thank you, Sir Hero.

443
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,320
By the way, boss, do you know a place that'll buy these fragments?

444
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,900
There are shops for monster materials.

445
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,570
They'll buy most things off of ya.

446
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,700
Thanks.

447
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,740
Yum!

448
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,040
The food at the castle was great too,

449
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,210
but a pub is where you experience real otherworld cuisine!

450
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,670
I hope you relish the meal.

451
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,010
The meadow we fought in was over here, right?

452
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,630
Yes.

453
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,680
Tomorrow, we'll be heading to Lafan Village, which lies beyond this map.

454
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,310
Past Lafan Village lies a dungeon for rookie adventurers.

455
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,520
A dungeon?

456
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,820
We won't make much money there, but it's the perfect spot for you to level up.

457
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,940
Oh, I see.

458
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,240
Now that I have new equipment,

459
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,240
it should be a walk in the park with you defending me.

460
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,070
Thanks. Very informative.

461
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,200
No problem.

462
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,580
By the way, Sir Hero,

463
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,290
aren't you going to drink your wine?

464
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,040
Nah, I'm not into booze.

465
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,920
Really? This is pretty good, you know.

466
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,780
I'd love to drink with you.

467
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,020
She suddenly became twice as seductive!

468
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,980
But...

469
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,310
S-Sorry. I really don't like it.

470
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,690
Is that so? That's too bad.

471
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,700
That's a hero for you, I suppose.

472
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,240
What do you mean?

473
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,660
This country is a matriarchy.

474
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:45,000
No man would ever dare turn down a drink offered by a woman.

475
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,210
Really? I'm not very good at picking up on this stuff.

476
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,960
Don't worry about it.

477
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,460
I'm glad we got to discuss our plans moving forward.

478
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,840
I'd like to turn in early tonight. Is that okay?

479
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,050
Of course.

480
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,800
I'll head up after I drink some more...

481
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,560
Although I feel so lonely drinking alone.

482
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,520
H-Hey, Myne?

483
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,860
Thanks for joining me, a shield hero who can't fight at all.

484
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,570
I turned you down tonight, but I'll make it up to you someday.

485
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,490
It's totally fine.

486
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,620
Good night, Sir Hero.

487
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,120
Night.

488
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,080
Two hundred silvers left.

489
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,210
Two rooms at 30 coppers a night each,

490
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,340
and meals for two at five coppers each...

491
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,180
That leaves a little more than 199 silvers.

492
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,430
I'm such a stereotypical Japanese tourist,stashing money like this.

493
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,480
What a day.

494
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,860
I wonder if that's how it truly feels to kill a monster.

495
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,320
I just went around popping balloons today.

496
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,330
But man, I really did come to another world!

497
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,460
I leveled up quite a bit today.

498
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,540
I won't let you outshine me tomorrow.

499
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,500
See you tomorrow, then.

500
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,960
Is that Motoyasu and Itsuki?

501
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,960
See you.

502
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,590
Guess I'll sleep.

503
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,380
Early start tomorrow and all.

504
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,860
Time to get some breakfast and head out!

505
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,150
Huh?

506
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,490
Gone...

507
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,740
It's gone!

508
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,330
The silvers, the chain mail,

509
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,160
and even my own clothes I'd kept for a rainy day are gone!

510
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,790
No way...

511
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,040
I got robbed in my sleep?!

512
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,130
Big trouble, Myne! Our money and equipment is gone!

513
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,390
Are you still asleep?

514
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,020
Wake up, Myne! We've got big trouble!

515
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,730
You're knights from the castle, right?

516
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,440
I'm glad you're here. Listen to this...

517
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,770
The Shield Hero, yes?

518
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,650
Yeah, why?

519
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,530
The king has issued a summons for you.

520
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,200
Come with us.

521
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,070
Huh?

522
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,450
That hurts!

523
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,670
What's going on?

524
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,000
Myne! You're okay?

525
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,800
Myne?

526
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,090
Yo, King!

527
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:48,640
I had all my money and equipment other than the shield stolen while I was asleep!

528
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,310
Please find the thief—

529
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,770
Quiet, scumbag!

530
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,480
What's that about?

531
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,860
Myne, you poor adventurer,

532
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,190
could you please testify once more for us?

533
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:09,160
Th-The Shield Hero barged into my room drunk and pinned me down...

534
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,410
Huh?

535
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,210
He said, "The night is still young,"

536
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,540
and tore my clothes off!

537
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,090
I somehow escaped

538
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:25,760
and ran to Sir Motoyasu, who happened to be staying in the same inn, for help!

539
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,310
Wh-What the hell?

540
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,930
If she hadn't asked me to wait till dawn and call the knights,

541
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,520
I would've cut you down myself!

542
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,940
What are you talking about?!

543
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,940
I went straight to bed after dinner last night!

544
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,150
Wait, that chain mail...

545
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,570
You were the robber?!

546
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,070
Who are you calling a robber?

547
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,540
Myne gave this to me as a present when I met her at the pub yesterday.

548
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:00,540
To think the Shield Hero would commit the gravest sin in this country.

549
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,750
Sin?

550
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,880
In Melromarc, even attempting to sexually assault a woman is punishable by death!

551
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,680
If you weren't a hero, you would be executed immediately!

552
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,640
Executed?

553
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,850
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong idea!

554
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,020
I didn't do it!

555
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,940
If you're so convinced I did, show me the proof!

556
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,490
When we searched the Shield Hero's room,

557
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,990
um, we found this on his bed.

558
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,620
Eek!

559
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,030
You animal!

560
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,660
There you have it. Undeniable proof.

561
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,620
How? It wasn't there when I woke up!

562
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,330
It's too bad.

563
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,630
I was worried something bad might happen, but I was hoping you'd know better.

564
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,090
He thinks a hero can do whatever the hell he wants and get away with it.

565
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,260
That's not even the least bit true.

566
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,810
You're not the be all and end all in this world!

567
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,680
Know your place!

568
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,560
What is all this?

569
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,940
What the hell is going on?

570
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,400
Myne... Myne!

571
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,900
Why would you lie like that?

572
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,610
Weren't we supposed to be a party?

573
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,490
I see.

574
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,680
Joining me was just a ruse to destroy me right here.

575
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,000
It was all a lie!

576
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,210
The smiles she showed me, and her acts of kindness, were all fake!

577
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,800
You tricked me!

578
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,430
It was a setup all along!

579
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,640
Sir Motoyasu, I'm so scared!

580
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,390
Shut your mouth, you criminal!

581
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,390
Screw you, too!

582
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,060
I bet you did all this to steal my money and equipment!

583
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,350
You two planned this together, didn't you?!

584
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,770
Yeah, come to think of it...

585
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,190
Myne only ever called me "Sir Hero,"

586
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,360
but she's calling Motoyasu by name!

587
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,400
If that isn't proof they were in it together, I don't know what is!

588
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,000
Refusing to admit his guilt and making nonsensical accusations?

589
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,210
I know, right?

590
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,420
I don't think he deserves any mercy, either.

591
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:08,010
It really was a mistake to summon all four together.

592
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,550
Exactly. They never should've summoned the Shield Hero.

593
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,800
But who would've thought he'd be such scum?

594
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,890
The shield... It's all about the shield again?

595
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,770
Because I'm the Shield Hero...

596
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:26,020
Because I'm weak, they're trying to knock me down to make themselves look better.

597
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,230
Disgusting.

598
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,110
These people are all dirty, disgusting filth!

599
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,660
This country's people don't believe in me one bit, too.

600
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,160
Why should I have to fight for them?

601
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,080
Fine. I don't care anymore.

602
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,290
Just send me back to my world.

603
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,130
And summon a new Shield Hero or whatever the hell you want!

604
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,260
Another world? Screw that!

605
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,470
Why should I have to go through this in a whole different world?!

606
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,470
You're going to run as soon as things go south?

607
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,930
Could you stoop any lower?

608
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:01,350
After all you've done, how could you even think about not doing your job?

609
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,850
Yeah, get lost.

610
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,150
Who wants to fight alongside a rapist?

611
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,060
Shut up!

612
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,070
Now, send me back to my world already!

613
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,320
Well, I'd love to do as you wish and kick you out,

614
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,830
but legend says new heroes can only be summoned once all Four Cardinal Heroes die.

615
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,790
What?

616
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,290
No way...

617
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,040
So I can't even go home?

618
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:35,430
Well, you can certainly go home after you fight off all the incoming Waves.

619
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,350
Are you saying we'll have to fight alongside a guy like him?

620
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,520
Screw that!

621
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,150
I'll handle the Waves my way, then!

622
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,690
Don't move!

623
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,820
Get off of me already!

624
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,740
This guy...

625
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,280
What'll it be?

626
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,450
Will you throw me in jail until the Waves arrive?

627
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,080
I won't imprison you.

628
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,330
There's hardly any time until the next Wave.

629
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:09,710
Scum or not, you're still a hero, one of the only beings who can fight the Waves.

630
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,800
But news of your crime is already spreading among the people.

631
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,050
That is your punishment.

632
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,180
Don't think you'll ever get to lead a decent life in this country.

633
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,470
I know that already!

634
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,770
This is what you wanted, right?

635
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,860
You can shove it up your ass!

636
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,810
Hey! Wait a second!

637
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,110
I'm really weak, you see.

638
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,980
I don't have a second to waste.

639
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,290
And just like that,

640
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:54,550
all my money, respect, and trust was gone.

641
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,260
I lost it all.

642
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,600
Hey, kid with the shield.

643
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,730
I heard what you did to that girl.

644
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,230
You deserve a punch to the face!

645
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,690
You too?

646
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,700
You...

647
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,120
What? Weren't you going to punch me?

648
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,910
I changed my mind.

649
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,160
Good. You were about to lose your life there.

650
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,000
Wait a second.

651
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,090
You'll never make it dressed like that.Consider this a parting gift.

652
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,840
How much?

653
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,590
Doesn't matter.

654
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,600
But let's call it a clearance sale and say five coppers.

655
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,930
Gotcha.

656
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,140
I promise to come pay you someday.

657
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,110
Don't die, kid.

Well, for these things...

666
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,090
How does 1 copper for a pair sound?

667
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,870
Sure. I'll take that.

668
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,620
Thanks.

669
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,070
Come again.

670
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,960
Welcome.

671
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,020
Buy these.

672
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,930
Oh? Orange balloons, huh?

673
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,660
Twenty in all.

674
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,440
How does 1 copper sound?

675
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,020
Didn't you offer that guy 1 copper for two?

676
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,240
Did I, now?

677
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,960
You must understand,I have a business to run.

678
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,610
That so?

679
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,410
Will these things fetch a better price, then?

680
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,520
They're pretty lively.

681
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,000
Gah!

682
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,090
S-Stop it!

683
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,090
I'm not trying to rip you off here.

684
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,500
All I want is a fair market price.

685
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,650
Or wait, do you hate me for some reason, maybe?

686
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,730
F-Fine! I get it!

687
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,640
I understand, so get these things off me!

688
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,270
We have a deal.

689
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,950
Instead of trying to fleece me, if you buy from me regularly,

690
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,770
I'm willing to give you a small discount.

691
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,340
C-Consider it done!

692
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:06,640
As much as I'd like to refuse, the goods and money are without sin.

693
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,280
Also, feel free to tell people all about me.

694
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,290
Tell them that any trader that messes with me will end up with bite marks all over.

695
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,940
No need to ask me. I was about to do just that.

696
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,000
To a long business relationship.

697
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,720
Aren't these...

698
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,980
New Shields Unlocked

699
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,380
There are shields with available skill unlocks.

700
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,090
Mastery BonusWhen a shield is used for a while to achieve a certain level of proficiency, it will grant its wielder permanent bonuses.

701
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:10,380
So by mastering a shield, I can keep itsabilities even after I switch to another one?

702
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,720
Leaf Shield.

703
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,840
This really is like a game, through and through.

Foraging Skill 1 ActivatedAero: *

705
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,700
It can improve the mat's quality?

706
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,280
Wow, this is good stuff.

707
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,760
Where did you get these?

708
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,970
In the forest right outside the castle.

709
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,010
Didn't you know?

710
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:47,410
Hmm... I never knew you could find such fine stuff there.

711
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,690
I was sure the quality was more average.

712
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,540
Ever since that day,nothing I eat has any flavor.

713
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,660
O Great Shield Hero,

714
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,830
we'll join your party.

715
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,940
Yeah, yeah. Thank your lucky stars.

716
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,440
Let's go ahead and discuss the terms first.

717
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,760
Okay!

718
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Your pay will be entirely performance-based.

719
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,140
I trust you know what that means.

720
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,020
Nope, no clue!

721
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,940
It means you'll be paid according to the loot we get on our adventure.

722
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,020
I'm the leader, so I'll take at least 40 percent.

723
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,950
I'll split the rest at my discretion.

724
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,030
If you do nothing, you get paid nothing.

725
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,250
The hell? That means you could keep it all for yourself!

726
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,620
I promise to pay you if you do your job.

727
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,290
If you can do your job.

728
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,250
Let's go get us some equipment, then!

729
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,970
Buy your equipment yourselves.

730
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,300
I have no reason to do that much for you.

731
00:41:59,300 --> 00:41:59,990
Huh?

732
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,350
Forget it. Just hand over your money.

733
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,810
If you'd said that to begin with, we could've saved some time.

734
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,100
What do we have here?

735
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,690
Aren't you awfully obedient.

736
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,220
Quit freakin' out!

737
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,530
Ow...

738
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,030
Shit!

739
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:33,000
I have the defense, but lack offensive ability.

740
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,550
Because I lack it, I can't defeat monsters.

741
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,130
And because I can't defeat them, I can't farm EXP.

742
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,320
And because I can't farm,my offensive ability never goes up.

743
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,790
What an awful loop!

744
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,930
Damn it!

745
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,730
You seem to be having trouble.

746
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,220
You don't have help.

747
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,980
But I have just what you need.

748
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,680
If you're offering me party members, thanks but no thanks.

749
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,770
Party members?

750
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:14,250
Please. What I'm offering you is a service far more convenient.

751
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,450
What would that be?

752
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,500
Interested, are we?

753
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,750
Get away from me.

754
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,770
That look in your eyes is the kind I just love.

755
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,390
You're every bit the man the rumors said you were.

756
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,670
You know who I am?

757
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,120
Of course I do, Shield Hero.

758
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:37,790
If my offer interests you, please follow me.

759
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,700
Here we are.

760
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:57,790
So, what exactly are you offering me?

761
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,360
Can't you tell at a glance?

762
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,760
Slaves!

763
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,320
Slaves?

764
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,710
Yes. I run a slave trading business.

765
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,270
What makes you think I want a slave?

766
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:17,380
The fact that they cannot lie or betray their master.

767
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,620
Slaves are placed under the effect of a curse.

768
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:27,100
A strong, seal-based curse that can take their very lives.

769
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,290
What do you say?

770
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,100
Show me what you've got.

771
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,600
I knew it. You have everything it takes to be a most wonderful patron.

772
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,680
I see ones that aren't human, too.

773
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,200
You can call them human, technically.

774
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,490
Tell me more. I don't know much about this world.

775
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:55,810
Creatures that look human but aren't are called demi-humans.

776
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,610
They're mostly used in manual labor or as servants.

777
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:04,310
Beastmen are demi-humans whose appearance leans more toward the animal side.

778
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:09,310
They're used as bodyguards or as participants in death matches that are gambled on.

779
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,390
I see.

780
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,720
But they both fall under the same category, huh?

781
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,640
Indeed. And since demi-humans are thought to be closer to monsters,

782
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,300
life would be hard for them in this country, which practices human supremacy.

783
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,620
As such, they're treated as slaves.
