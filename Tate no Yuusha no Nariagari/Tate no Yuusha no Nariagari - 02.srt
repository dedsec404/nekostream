1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,640
Sir...

2
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,750
This slave here is my recommendation.

3
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,420
It's level 75.

4
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,570
That's close to twenty times my level.

5
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,460
How much for this one?

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,710
Well, it is highly capable in battle.

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,480
How does 15 gold pieces sound?

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,180
Showing me your most expensive slave knowing that I can't afford it, huh?

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,580
Indeed. You're sure to become one of my best patrons,

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,360
so I need you to develop a keen eye, you see.

11
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,700
Well...

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,730
Now that you've seen my best,

13
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,460
let me ask you: what kind of slave would you like?

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,570
One that's cheap and obedient.

15
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,910
In other words,

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,120
a demi-human?

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,300
These aren't suited for combat or manual labor.

18
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,720
If I need them in battle, I'll train them.

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,830
That's an amusing response,

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,260
when you don't believe in people.

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,790
But slaves aren't people.

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,340
Training one is no different than upgrading my shield.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Well, you've got me there.

24
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,500
These are the cheapest slaves I can offer you.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,650
From the left...

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,800
Raise your head.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,980
That half-raccoon is diseased and has a mental disorder.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,020
I'm having a real hard time with her myself.

29
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,330
Her previous owner loved his torture, you see.

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,600
I doubt she'll last much longer.

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,670
I've decided.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,500
I'll take this one.

33
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,740
The Slave Girl

34
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,850
Let's begin.

35
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,740
Hey...

36
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,440
Worry not.

37
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,400
The pain will dissipate soon.

38
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,770
The slave crest on her chest makes it impossible for her to defy you.

39
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,640
Acquired Slave A.

40
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,930

Now this girl is all yours.

47
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,700
Thirty silvers, right?

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,870
There's one extra in here.

49
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,460
That's your commission.

50
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,980
You were going to wring it out of me anyway, weren't you?

51
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,610
You certainly know your stuff.

52
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,130
Well, I guess I should know your name.

53
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,340
Tell me your name.

54
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,420
What's your name?

55
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,170
R-Raphtalia...

56
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,220
Raphtalia, huh?

57
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,180
Let's go.

58
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,690
I'm looking forward to your next visit.

59
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,770
So he really did choose her.

60
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,990
I'm getting goosebumps!

61
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,990
Welcome!

62
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,490
Oh, it's you, kid.

63
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,370
Hey, hey... What's with the girl?

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,880
Give me a weapon she can use.

65
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,180
Keep it under six silvers.

66
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,050
Took you long enough.

67
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,340
I-I'm sorry.

68
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,840
Whatever.

69
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,590
Raphtalia, draw your knife.

70
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,310
Let me see you stab and burst this thing.

71
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,270
N-No...

72
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,190
This is an order!

73
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,360
You only hurt yourself by refusing.

74
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,690
Do it!

75
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,410
Too weak!

76
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,710
Put more heart in it!

77
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,630
Do it!

78
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,130
Huh? I got EXP, too?

79
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,350
Probably because you set her as acompanion when forming the pact.

80
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,930
Wait, you didn't do thatwith the lady from before?

81
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,020
Damn that woman...

82
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,480
Listen up.

83
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,780
From here on out, I expect you to fight monsters for me.

84
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,200
I bought you with what little money I had.

85
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,740
You'd better help me recoup your cost, at least.

86
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Kid, you're not going to die a painless death.

87
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,870
Thanks for the compliment.

88
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,420
Quit sitting around. Let's go.

89
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,670
Y-Yes!

90
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,210
Sheesh...

91
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,760
I don't know whether it's our country to blame, or if the kid's just been corrupted.

92
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,100
Three silvers left...

93
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,350
Get a move on!

94
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,560
We don't have all day, you little shits!

95
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,320
What's wrong with you, you moron?!

96
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,740
I'm sorry!

97
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,110
Are you hungry?

98
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,200
No.

99
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,280
You can't fight on an empty stomach.

100
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,200
Let's get some lunch.

101
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:28,760
We don't serve demi-humans.

102
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,420
U-Um...

103
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,330
What's wrong?

104
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,250
This place...

105
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,130
Hurry up!

106
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,040
Welcome!

107
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,550
Ack, it's the Shield Hero...

108
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,140
Is he the rapist?

109
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,800
Keep it down! He'll hear you!

110
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,390
Can I order?

111
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,850
Huh? I-I guess...

112
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,750
Look, it's a demi-human.

113
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,440
Why's a demi here?

114
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,190
The cheapest lunch set you have.

115
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,060
Someone kick her out!

116
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,230
And she'll have whatever that kid's having.

117
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,740
That'll be nine coppers.

118
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,400
Sure.

119
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,410
Why?

120
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,490
Did you want something else?

121
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,330
Why are you getting it for me?

122
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,630
Because you looked like you wanted to try it.

123
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,000
Here's your food.

124
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,590
Aren't you going to eat?

125
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,550
Can I really?

126
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,060
Yes, just eat up.

127
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Drink this.

128
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,540
Is it good?

129
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,250
Yeah!

130
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,890
I still don't taste a thing.

131

Who are you?

145
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,920
A hero. The shield one.

146
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,130
You mean... One of the Four Cardinal Heroes?

147
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,670
Yeah.

Raphtalia...

149
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,850
Do you know of the four legendary heroes?

150
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,980
Yep! The ones with the sword, the bow, and the spear...

151
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,730
And then, the one with the shield!

152
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,940
Correct.

153
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,240
The Shield Hero, in particular, treated us demi-humans very well.

154
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,200
Really? I'd like to meet him.

155
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,830
If you're a good girl, I'm sure you'll meet him one day.

156
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,340
The Shield Hero...

157
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,760
U-Um... What is your name?

158
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,840
Iwatani Naofumi.

159
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,800
Iwatani... Naofumi.

160
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,300
Drink this.

161
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,730
It's a medicine I blended.

162
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,520
Apparently, it can cure mild colds.

163
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,350
Drink it.

164
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,690
So bitter!

165
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,950
Good medicine tastes bitter.

166
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,820
Just drink it all.

167
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,640
We're sorry, Raphtalia.

168
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,230
We want you to live, Raphtalia.

169
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,150
Please forgive our selfishness.

170
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,770
No!

171
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,620
Dad! Mom!

172
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,700
What's wrong?

173
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,410
Calm down!

174
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,040
No... Help...

175
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,120
Just calm down.

176
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,290
No! Dad, Mom!

177
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,580
Don't cry.

178
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
It's okay.

179
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,880
It's all right.

180
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,810
The quality's not bad.

181
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,100
Are you well versed in making medicines, Sir Hero?

182
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,400
Yesterday was my first try.

183
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,560
Oh?

184
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,520
Which is more profitable, selling herbs or medicine?

185
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,280
Due to the Wave's impact, medicine is flying off the shelves lately,

186
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,490
so I'd pay more for medicine than for herbs.

187
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,620
I see.

188
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,000
In total, this is worth four silvers.

189
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,250
Say, do you have any tools you don't use anymore?

190
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,750
Here we go!

191
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,460
Okay!

192
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,630
One, two...

193
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,670
Raphtalia.

194
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,670
Hup!

195
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,880
Do you want one of those balls?

196
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,800
N-Not at all!

197
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,350
I don't want it at all!

198
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,850
So she wants one, huh?

199
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,510
You can play with it afterwe're done with work.

200
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,820
Thank you!

201
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,240
Coming!

202
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,530
Uh, the Shield Hero...

203
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,070
I'd like to rent a room.

204
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,450
My companion might scream at night, though.

205
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,250
You will let us stay, right?

206
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,790
O-Of course! I'll prepare a room at once!

207
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,340
I have to find a way to survive before the next Wave of Catastrophe hits.

208
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,340
All right. We can go a little deeper into the forest now...

209
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,880
A rabbit?

210
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,220
Watch out!

211
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,390
Now, Raphtalia! Stab it!

212
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,430
What's wrong? Get on with it!

213
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,600
B-But... It'll bleed if I do...

214
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,650
Hurry up!

215
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,390
I'm scared of blood!

216
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,990
Listen well.

217
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,700
If you can't fight, then I won't be able to look after you anymore.

218
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,370
A Wave that threatens the world's existence is coming soon.

219
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,540
I have to get as strong as I can before it does.

220
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,880
But defense is all I'm good for.

221
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,340
I need someone to fight for me.

222
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,680
If you can't do it, I'll get someone else.

223
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,260
So...

224
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,890
You're going to fight the Catastrophe?

225
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,640
That is my job.

226
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,350
Got it.

227
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,830
Master... I'll fight for you.

228
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,000
So please don't throw me away.

229
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,580
All right.

230
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,580
This is reality.

231
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,460
Not a game.

232
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,010
If I want to live, I have no choice but to fight!

233
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,390
Sell us a new weapon for this amount.

234
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,600
Time to get the little miss a sword, then.

235
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,940
One on the short side would be good to start off.

236
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,730
How about this?

237
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,690
It's a short sword made of iron.

238
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,280
Boss...

239
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,200
Is there a town or village nearby that we can travel to with our equipment?

240
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,200
Well, with your stuff, it'd have to be here.

241
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,290
The Village of Lute

242
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,540
How much?

243
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,170
Around two silvers in all, I'd say.

244
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,500
Is that so?

245
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,840
Hey, do you know of any spots nearby when you can earn a lot of money quick?

246
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,260
Hmm...

247
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,930
The ores from that coal pit over there should fetch a decent amount, but...

248
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,880
Is there a catch?

249
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,810
Ever since the first Wave, it's become home to a bunch of dangerous monsters.

250
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,400
Nobody dares approach it anymore.

251
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,690
I see.

252
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,200
Sheesh! I don't know what our summoned "heroes" are even doing.

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,680
Air Strike Shield!

265
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,480
Master?

266
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,400
It's nothing. Let's go.

267
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,030
There are dangerous monsters here, apparently.

268
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,040
The moment things go south, we run.

269
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,540
You'd better keep up.

270
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,210
Okay!

271
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,670
U...

272
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,750
Um...

273
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,630
What is it?

274
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,300
How should I address you, Master?

275
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,720
Call me whatever.

276
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,430
Th-Then...

277
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,100
Is this the place?

278
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,980
All right.

279
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,350
Are those...

280
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,900
This will fetch a pretty penny.

281
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,360
Raphtalia, let's try over there next...

282
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,540
No!

283
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,140
You okay?

284
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,390
D-Dog monster...

285
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,860
Killed all the villagers, even Dad and Mom...

286
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,650
During the first Wave, huh?

287
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,150
So that's why she starts crying every night.

288
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,790
Is that the same dog that killed your parents?

289
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,500
No...

290
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,620
Listen, Raphtalia.

291
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,500
Take that thing out here and now.

292
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,220
If you fight and make me stronger,

293
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,890
we can fend off the Waves of Catastrophe and prevent that tragedy from reoccurring.

294
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,010
Your parents won't ever come back.

295
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,850
But we can prevent other kids from going through what you did.

296
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,690
And all I'm capable of is making sure you can fight as best you can!

297
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,870
Now, Raphtalia!

298
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,540
Stab it with your sword!

299
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,450
Now!

300
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,450
No...

301
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,130
If I die, so will you!

302
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:12,960
Please no!

303
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Then hurry up and kill it!

304
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,630
This is an order!

305
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,690
Raphtalia, forget it.

306
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,320
If you can't fight, then get out of here.

307
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,650
But what about you?

308
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,660
I'll buy time for you to escape.

309
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,910
What?

310
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,120
That'd be just like then...

311
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,580
Hurry up and go!

312
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,000
Master!

313
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,670
No...

314
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,760
No!

315
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,930
Don't go!

316
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,770
Don't leave me!

317
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,320
Don't die!

318
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,200
Air Strike Shield!

319
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,950
Raphtalia!

320
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,680
Well done.

321
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,350
Naofumi-sama!

322
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,850
Hey, even with the shield's power, the wound still hurts!

323
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,810
Don't ever die! Please don't leave me alone!

324
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,690
Naofumi-sama!

325
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,650
She chose my name, huh?

326
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,660
You attack, and I defend.

327
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,450
That way, neither of us will die.

328
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,790
Right.

329
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,670
We're leaving once I feed this monster to my shield.

330
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,090
Okay, Naofumi-sama.

331
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,550
Get off already.

332
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,510
A bit longer...

333
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,270
The ore made us a lot of money, so you can eat all you want.

334
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,160
Thank you!

335
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,150
Is it good?

336
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,070
Yeah!

337
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,910
I see.

338
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,150
