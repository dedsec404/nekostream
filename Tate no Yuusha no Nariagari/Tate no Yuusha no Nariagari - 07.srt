3
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,200
I've received an order for herbicide, Shield Hero.

4
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,030
A village to the south needs a lot of it, and immediately.

5
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,960
You're the only one I can ask. You have the Heavenly Fowl.

6
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,420
Why would they need herbicide so quickly, and so much of it?

7
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,460
Master, the plants here are amazing.

8
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,060
Yeah, you'd definitely need herbicide for this.

9
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,680
Look, Naofumi-sama.

10
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,310
Take us there, Filo.

11
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,190
Okay!

12
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,820
Thank you so much.

13
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,490
This place was about to fall to the vines, too.

14
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,700
Couldn't you have burned them?

15
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,330
We tried everything we could think of.

16
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,040
We even summoned adventurers,but the situation remains grave.

17
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Our village was already overrun by vines.

18
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,970
What's worse, the plants turned into monsters and attacked us.

19
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,190
Turned into monsters?

20
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,480
Some adventurers set out for the village to level up.

21
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,310
I tried to stop them, but to no avail.

22
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,020
Filo, grab the adventurers and bring them back here.

23
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,490
Okay. Be wighd bag.

24
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,750
Plant monsters were all over the place.

25
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,500
Some even spat poison or acid.

26
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,880
Why would these guys go there when they're so weak?

27
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,210
They must be stupid.

28
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,350
You didn't have to say that last part.

29
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,790
Huh?

30
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,380
Don't "huh" me.

31
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,510
Ugh...

32
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,550
Hey, that bird that talked.

33
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,140
Don't "ugh" me either.

34
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,260
Tch.

35
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,260
Could it be...

36
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,970
That has to be the Heavenly Fowl!

37
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,980
The Savior of the Heavenly Fowl has come to our village, too!

38
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,320
Are you the savior who travels in a carriage drawn by a heavenly fowl?

39
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,820
You've got the wrong guy.

40
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,440
Naofumi-sama...

41
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,890
We beg you!

42
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,410
Could you please heal our sick using your powers?

43
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,490
Wait, some of you are sick?

44
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,040
As you can see, the plants are devouring their bodies.

45
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,090
They're even parasitic?

46
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,010
Please, Savior! Help them with your powers!

47
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,970
I can't say for sure that I'll be able to heal them.

Next.

50
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,200
Yeah.

51
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,490
I'm glad it went well.

52
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,320
Yeah.

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,080
But we're leaving as soon as we get paid for the treatment.

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,370
I don't want to be dragged any further into this mess.

55
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,630
I daresay that might be difficult.

56
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,250
Our Savior of the Heavenly Fowl!

57
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,760
Please save our village!

58
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,600
Our village was being ravaged by famine when the Spear Hero visited.

59
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,100
When he heard of our plight,

60
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,070
he went to some nearby ruins and brought back a seed that had been sealed there.

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,820
He called it a miracle seed.

62
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,110
A miracle seed that was sealed away?

63
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,490
That was it, huh?

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,290
At first, we were overjoyed when we saw how quickly the plants grew and bore fruit.

65
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,570
However...

66
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,300
They grew too much and overwhelmed your village?

67
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,340
Indeed.

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,550
While investigating our options,

69
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,510
we hit upon a legend passed down the village.

70
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,600
A long time ago, an alchemist who'd set up shop in this area created a seed,

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,010
but sealed it away for some reason.

72
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:41,230
The legend also said that plants had overtaken the region for a while.

73
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,820
Hold on a second.

74
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,970
Why did none of you have doubts about that seed if you knew about this legend?

75
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,120
You convinced yourself it was safe because a hero brought it to you?

76
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:01,630
We'll pay for treatments, and for the monster extermination, in advance!

77
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,840
Please save our village!

78
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,510
I don't like cleaning up after that moron Motoyasu,

79
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,600
but I'll earn my keep.

80
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,980
That shield... Could it be?

81
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,310
Let's go, Filo!

82
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,050
Take that thing out, and it'll all be over?

83
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,470
I hope it's that easy.

84
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,760
Master, I'm going.

85
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,890
Wait, Filo!

00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,930
Air Strike Shield!

87
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,530
It regenerates too quickly.

Got it!

92
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,460
Let's go, Filo.

93
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,420
Okay.

Don't hold me back, Onee-chan!

95
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,100
H-Hold you back?

96
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,180
Watch out!

97
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,440
Did you just laugh, Filo?

98
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,110
No, I did not.

99
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,240
Never mind that. Get the herbicide.

100
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,950
"Never mind"?

101
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,370
Regenerating again?

102
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,830
Come to think of it...

103
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,750
If the Potion Enhance skill works on the herbicide as well...

104
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,340
Stay away, Naofumi-sama!

105
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,520
You're amazing, Master!

106

That one was mine.

113
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,950
I got it first.

114
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,530
Me!

115
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,410

No, me!

118
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,120

What are you doing?

122
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,520
I unlocked a skill called Plant Modification, so I tried a little experiment.

123

We just barely took down that monster, so please don't be so reckless.

Thank you so much, Our Savior... No, Shield Hero!

125
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,620
I exterminated the monsters.

Those look yummy!

147
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,330
I curbed their breeding and mutation potential,

148
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,670
then increased their growth and productivity.

149
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,710
With this, they should bear lots of edible fruit without turning into monsters.

Wow.

151
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,630
The village will never have to worry about famine again.

152
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,050
Thank you so much, Sir Hero!

153
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,680
Not only did you save us from danger,

154
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,180
you're giving us such a wonderful gift!

I'll sell you these seeds.

158
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,940
For the right price, of course.

159
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,360
You're too greedy, Naofumi-sama.

160
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,990
B-But we paid everything we had for the treatment and extermination.

161
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,240
You can also exchange goods for them.

162
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,620
What? But we have nothing left...

163
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,420

We have so much fruit,

167
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,090
most of it will rot before we can eat it.

168
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,800
Don't worry. I know someone we can sell it to.

169
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,140
This seed certainly is very impressive.

170
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,640
I'll gladly buy it all, including the produce.

171
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,230
We have a deal, then.

172
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,150
You placed several attractive products in sight to create an advantage.

173
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,200
You truly are a shining example of the trader's spirit!

174
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,950
Is that so?

175
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,780
Oh, yes.

176
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,490
If you aren't busy, could I request your assistance with a job?

177
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,460
There's a hot springs town not too far away from here.

178
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,670
I need you to deliver some goods to an inn there.

179
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,420
Great. The order is complete.

180
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,720
See you.

181
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,390
There are hot springs towns in this world, too?

182
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,100
So warm!

183
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,350
Hey, Master.

184
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,480
I wanna go in this hot spring thing, too.

185
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,520
Hot spring, huh?

186
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,860
How about you, Raphtalia?

187
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,030
I'm not {\i1}that{\i0} interested.

188
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,030
But if you and Filo want to go, I'll accompany you.

189
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,950
That's that. We're spending the night here.

190
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,120
Thank you—

191
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,620
Master!

192
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,460
I wuv you!

193
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,930
I'm happy that we're staying in a hot springs inn,

194
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,060
but Filo's being too clingy with Naofumi-sama.

195
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,680
I want to be clingy with him, too!

196
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,070
"The origin of this hot spring, and its benefits"?

197
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,990
What does a silver boar have to do with a hot spring?

198
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,450
Whatever.

199
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,830
Its effects are... success in love?!

200
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,750
"A couple that enters this hot spring together will be united forever"?!

201
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,000
Th-Then, if I can take a b-bath together with Naofumi-sama...

202
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,300
N-No, Naofumi-sama!

203
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,050
We can't k-k-kiss! I'll get pregnant!

204
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,850
Wow, an open-air bath?

205
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,310
Naofumi-sama?

206
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,270
So big!

207
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,480
Filo, don't swim in the bath.

208
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,190
I can't?

209
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,860
Wait, is that okay in this world?

210
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,780
I was wondering why Filo wasn't here yet,and she's with Naofumi-sama?

211
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,580
You swim too, Master.

212
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,870
I'm not going to.

213
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,790
Then wash my hair.

214
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,670
Can't you do it yourself?

215
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,800
In the end, Filo was with Naofumi-sama the whole time.

216
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,890
Anyway, I want to share this drink with him.

217
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,270
That feels good, Master.

218
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,980
You have way too much hair. Brushing it is a pain.

219
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,310
Really?

220
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,610
Raphtalia had much shorter hair.

221
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,530
I wish he'd brush my hair too, like before.

222
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,280
Um...

223
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,870
I also...

224
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,950
Master, I'm thirsty.

225
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,160
Sit still,

226
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,000
or I won't brush your hair again.

227
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,540
No! It feels good, so keep going!

228
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,040
Also, do my feathers, too.

229
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,840
Do your wings yourself.

230
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,880
What's up, Raphtalia?

231
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,880
Nothing.

232
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,680
Onee-chan, gimme.

233
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,190
I have to do something, or Filo will steal my Naofumi-sama.

234
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,330
If I want to turn this around all at once...

235
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,840
Mom used to say that a gift was the best way to get your beloved's attention.

236
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,680
She fell in love with Dad after he gave her a gift, too.

237
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,770
If I can give him some latium...

238
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,640
Hey, have you heard of latium?

239
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,560
Oh, you mean that rare crystal found in this area?

240
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,070
Apparently, love charms made with it work really well.

241
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,820
What? Really?

242
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,950
A bird called a gagocco collects latium,

243
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,410
so if I find one of their nests,I'll get my hands on some!

244
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,210
And then, I'll give it to Naofumi-sama...

245
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,880
W-We mustn't, Naofumi-sama!

246
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,340
Like I said, if we kiss...

247
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,000
What's this about Master?

248
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,960
Huh? That voice...

249
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,670
Filo?

250
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,390
Why is she up in the mountains?

251
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,430
Is she after the latium, too?

252
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,220
You're here for the eggs too, aren't you?

253
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,020
Huh?

254
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,600
The old man at the inn told me

255
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,150
that the eggs of a bird called a gagocco are a rare delicacy.

256
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,110
Oh, she's just being a glutton like always.

257
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,990
She's still such a child.

258
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,160
If I take a rare delicacy to Master,

259
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,290
I'm sure he'll pet me and become my mate.

260
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,000
M-Mate?!

261
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,870
Mating means marriage!

262
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,870
Filo's thinking that far ahead?

263
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,500
So I won't let you have the eggs, Onee-chan.

264
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,300
Wait up!

265
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,720
Eggs, eggs, yummy eggs!

266
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,520
When did this become a race?

267
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
You're so slow, Onee-chan.

268
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,520
Watch out, Filo!

269
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,780
Ow...

270
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,080
Are you okay, Onee-chan?

271
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,370
Yeah. Are you okay?

272
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,870
Yep. Thanks.

273
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,250
It's good that this thing cushioned our fall.

274
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,310
What now?!

275
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,850
Onee-chan, get on me!

276
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,830
That was scary.

277
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,040
Thank you, Filo.

278
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,870
Now we're even, right?

279
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,840
Yep!

280
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,970
So that's a gagocco and its nest.

281
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,430
Eggs, eggs!

282
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,690
Sorry to scare you.

283
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,980
I just really need that crystal.

284
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,250
My eggs...

285
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,010
Onee-chan...

286
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,220
Yes.

287
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,280
In the end, we didn't find any other gagocco nests.

288
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,910
Will giving Naofumi-sama this thing instead make him happy?

289
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,200
Hey, you guys.

290
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,290
Is that a silver razorback?

291
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,420
Huh?

292
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,710
Like that thing over there.

293
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,840
Oh.

294
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,590
Could you give it to us?

295
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:44,180
Silver razorbacks are valuable prey, used as offerings in town rituals.

296
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,640
Please! We'll pay good money for it!

297
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,510
Money?

298
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,970
Onee-chan...

299
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,100
For me?

300
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Yep.

301
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,230
Filo and I picked it out.

302
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,650
We thought you might want a tool to help you craft metals.

303
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,820
I do...

304
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,780
But wasn't this pretty expensive?

305
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,240
It's a token of our gratitude to you, for always taking such good care of us.

306
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,160
Yep. A gift for you, Master.

307
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,210
Thanks. I'll make good use of it.

308
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,170
Also...

309
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,220
Both of you, go take a dip in the hot spring.

310
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,890
He still treats me like a child at times,

311
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,810
but I'll make him recognize my womanly charms one day!

312
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,410
Right, Filo?

313
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,770
Yep!

314
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,410
Godspeed.

315
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,680
An epidemic to the east?

316
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,870
Yeah. Medicine's flying off the shelves, apparently.

317
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,150
Where shall we head next, Naofumi-sama?

318
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,650
East.

319
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,930
{\fad(356,1)}Curse Shield

320
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,930
