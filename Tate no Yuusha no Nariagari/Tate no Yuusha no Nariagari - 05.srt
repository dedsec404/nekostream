1
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,520
Is that what the king has been up to?

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,530
Malty-sama must've talked him into it.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,990
How is the Shield Hero holding up?

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,700
He procured a demi-human girl from a slave trader.

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,160
Is that so?

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,170
That's a relief.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,170
However...

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,920
News of Melromarc's summoning of the Four Cardinal Heroes

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,800
is making waves here as well.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,140
We must prevent our neighbors from meddling, no matter what.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,140
We'll continue to keep an eye on things in the capital.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,600
I'm counting on you.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,120
As a reward for your efforts during the Wave and for fulfilling my request,

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,620
Motoyasu-dono will receive 4,000 silvers,

15
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,880
and Itsuki-dono and Ren-dono will receive 3,800.

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,300
And as agreed upon, I have set aside 500 silvers for the Shield.

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,390
However...

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,140
Since it's offset by the cost of freeing his slave from her curse,

19
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,560
he will receive no funds this time.

20
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,480
I don't think that's going to fly.

21
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,740
You interfered in his duel, dispelled the...

22
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,530
slave crest, was it?

23
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,530
And now you refuse to pay him what he deserves?

24
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,620
Right?

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,870
If you'd followed the rules, Naofumi clearly would've won that duel.

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,570
Wha... I didn't lose!

27
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,540
You're mistaken, Itsuki-sama, Ren-sama.

28
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,460
It was a one-on-one duel,

29
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,180
and the Shield Hero was the one with monsters hidden in his cape.

30
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,890
That is why Father didn't declare him the victor.

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,060
Even then, you cheated by firing a magic spell at him.

32
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,770
Get off me!

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,360
I'm a cowardly cheat, after all!

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,990
Besides, when the Wave hit,

35
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,950
it was Naofumi who defended that village in the knights' stead.

36
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,000
I believe he must be compensated in some way.

37
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,760
Very well. I shall afford him the minimum agreed amount.

38
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,850
You have it, so begone already!

39
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,730
Isn't it great, Naofumi-sama?

40
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,980
We don't have to waste our time in this place anymore.

41
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,150
We're leaving, Raphtalia.

42
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,270
{\fad(750,645)}The Rising of the Shield Hero

43
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,930
{\fad(438,596)}Filo

44
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,910
There we go.

45
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,270
She now has a new slave crest.

46
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,020
There was no need to get another one, you know.

47
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,360
But I wanted it, as a symbol of your faith in me.

48
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,190
If you say so.

49
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,910
A-Anyway, Naofumi-sama...

50
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,990
Um, what do you think?

51
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,620
Slave User's Shield, huh?

52
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,460
What is it?

53
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,380
{\fad(1,268)}Slave User's Shield

54
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,460
Nothing!

55
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,420
Still...

56
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,260
I'm amazed you helped that scrawny bag of bones grow so much in such a short time.

57
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,010
Even if she's not a virgin, she's guaranteed to fetch you twenty gold pieces.

58
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,600
I {\i1}am{\i0} a virgin!

59
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,100
Thirty-five, then!

60
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,980
Thirty-five gold pieces, huh?

61
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,770
Naofumi-sama!

62
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,190
What's that?

63
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,320
A monster egg lottery.

64
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,200
Pay 100 silvers, and you're guaranteed at least a filolial!

65
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,330
You'll win a monster chick that'll double in value if you raise it well.

66
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,950
A filolial?

67
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,540
You must've seen them around.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,500
They're the large birds that pull carriages around town.

69
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,590
Oh, those?

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,170
What's more, if you hit the jackpot,

71
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,140
you'll win a dragon worth twenty gold pieces!

72
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,760
What, it's like a gacha game?

73
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,270
What's a gacha game?

74
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,310
Nothing. Forget it.

75
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,650
Would you like to give it a shot?

76
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,650
Act now, and I'll give you a package deal for that and the slave crest!

77
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,860
You shouldn't waste money like that, Naofumi-sama.

78
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,660
Well, I figured it wouldn't be fair to make you fight alone all the time.

79
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,620
A monster should at least be some help.

80
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,330
I can fight by myself just fine!

81
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,840
If so, we can just sell it back to the slave trader.

82
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,590
Either way, don't loosen your purse strings any more.

83
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,800
Fine, I hear you.

84
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,510
Relatives of mine in Lute Village asked me to help you out.

85
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,560
Think it was someone you saved back then?

86
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,480
Who knows?

87
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,440
This book has recipes for finer medicines than you bring to me.

88
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,610
Use it. It's yours.

89
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,400
Uh, I can't read this world's language, though.

90
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,530
Oh, right.

91
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,120
The old hag at the magic shop wants to see you, too.

92
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,490
It's for a similar reason.

93
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,330
She said you helped her grandkid out in Lute Village.

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,290
You have an affinity for healing and support magic, Shield Hero.

95
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,760
And the young lady has light and dark magic affinity.

96
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,130
She is half-raccoon, after all.

97
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,470
I recommend she learn illusion magic and the like.

98
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,220
In which case...

99
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,650
We don't have the money to buy a magic grimoire.

100
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,020
It's free, as thanks for helping my grandkid.

101
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,360
I actually would've loved to give you a crystal ball instead.

102
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,320
Huh?

103
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,650
Don't you know?

104
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,580
If you use a crystal ball, you can learn one of the magics sealed in it.

105
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,290
First I've heard of that.

106
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,250
But I heard the royal court ordered a bunch of them for the heroes.

107
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,590
I bet they handed them out to every hero but me.

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,880
Learning magic from a grimoire is hard,

109
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,260
but if you keep at it, you can learn as many spells as you want!

110
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
Do your best!

111
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,100
Thank you.

112
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,020
"Thank you," huh?

113
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,650
I really can't read it.

114
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,110
I wish there was a skill that'd translate books for me.

115
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,700
Let's learn together, then.

116
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,030
What? The language and magic?

117
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,700
Well, yes.

118
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,790
But the key word there is "together."

119
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,330
There's more than a month until the next Wave,

120
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,880
so I guess there's no better plan.

121
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,340
Let's spend the night in Lute Village.

122
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,180
And tomorrow, we can go grind some levels after breakfast.

123
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,300
Sure!

124
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,390
Hey, wake up!

125
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Raphtalia!

126
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,330
It's so cute, Naofumi-sama!

127
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,170
It must think you're its mother.

128
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,510
Imprinting, huh?

129
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,340
We should think of a good name for it.

130
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,590
Yeah...

131
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,850
I can't believe she grew so much in just two days!

132
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,360
My Growth Boost skill probably helped.

133
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:31,560
Mon

134
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:31,610
Monster

135
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:31,650
Monster Tam

136
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:31,690
Monster Tamer's

137
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:31,730
Monster Tamer's Shield

138
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,190
Right, Filo?

139
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,270
Monster Tamer's Shield III

140
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,240
You named her Filo? As in "filolial"?

141
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,820
Don't you think that's a bit lazy?

142
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,450
She seems to like it, though.

143
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,580
Hey, look.

144
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,790
Why are the knights here?

145
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,300
In light of his exploits during the last Wave, the Spear Hero, Motoyasu-sama,

146
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,880
has been appointed ruling lord of this region.

147
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,180
To help the rebuilding efforts, we've decided to levy a toll.

148
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,100
Fifty silvers to enter the village, and fifty to exit.

149
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,190
That's absurd!

150
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,650
We won't even have anything to eat tomorrow!

151
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,190
You wish to defy your lord's orders?

152
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,690
Well, duh!

153
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,190
The Shield Hero?

154
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,110
You were still here?

155
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,990
This is Motoyasu-sama's domain now.

156
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,620
You have no right to question him.

157
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,000
In fact, get out this instant, criminal scum!

158
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,460
I don't mind leaving, but I don't think the villagers are gonna accept this.

159
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,500
Motoyasu, do you know how much it costs to spend a night at the inn here?

160
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,720
U-Uh...

161
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,850
It's one silver a night, food included.

162
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,850
You're charging a hundred nights' worth ofmoney just to enter and exit the village!

163
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,060
Yeah, yeah!

164
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,810
He's right!

165
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,610
Besides, you can't just show up and call yourself our lord.

166
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,440
And it was the Shield Hero who defended this village during the Wave!

167
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,280
You dare complain about a royal decree?

168
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,870
You people had better knock it off!

169
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,420
I trust you know who we are, Malty-sama.

170
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,380
Why are you people here?

171
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,840
For you.

172
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,220
Who are they, Naofumi-sama?

173
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,590
No idea, but I can tell they're important.

174
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,430
How could this be?

175
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,220
Shield Hero!

176
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,060
Fight us for the right to rule this village!

177
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,230
I refuse!

178
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,610
But if we lose this, the village will fall into the Spear Hero's hands!

179
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:47,120
As the current lord, even I cannot accept further taxation at this time!

180
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,500
But why does that mean I have to take part in a dragon race? It sounds like a pain.

181
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,790
They've asked for you.

182
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,880
And besides, we don't have the right to challenge a Hero.

183
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,840
That letter probably said something Myne didn't like.

184
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,720
So she challenged you to take it out on you?

185
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,060
Your filolial seems to be up for it.

186
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,400
What's wrong with her?

187
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,530
So it's true that filolials and dragons don't get along.

188
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,490
Please, we beg you!

189
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,530
We promise you a reward for winning!

190
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,240
I'm not responsible for what happens if I lose, okay?

191
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,960
So lame.

192
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,590
And it's a bird, not a dragon.

193
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,170
How are you gonna race my dragon with this?

194
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,180
Motoyasu-sama!

195
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,190
Motoyasu-sama!

196
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,940
Healing magic! Hurry!

197
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,400
Th-This is definitely going to bruise...

198
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,860
Right away!

199
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,480
You cheater!

200
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,610
It's his fault for getting too close.

201
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,160
I've never seen Naofumi-samasmile so much before.

202
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,870
The course will be three laps around the outskirts of this village.

203
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,580
Whoever reaches this gate first will be declared the winner.

204
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,500
Motoyasu-sama!

205
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,300
Good luck, Naofumi-sama!

206
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,880
On your marks...

207
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,180
Start!

208
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,350
Piece of cake.

209
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,580
As source of thy power, I order thee.

210
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,750
Decipher the laws of nature and create a pit in front of me.

211
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,000
Earth Hole!

212
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,840
No! The Shield Hero!

213
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
Filo!

214
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,220
Motoyasu-sama!

215
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,560
Keep it up!

216
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,400
As source of thy power, I order thee.

217
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,910
Decipher the laws of nature and slow my target.

218
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,320
Speed Down!

219
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,080
Here's my chance!

220
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,870
Damn it!

221
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,730
What are you doing? Run faster!

222
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,400
Filo! One last lap!

223
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,360
Accursed beast!

224
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,120
Decipher the laws of nature and hasten my target.

225
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,120
Fast Speed!

226
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,460
He's blocking my path!

227
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,920
We're heading straight for the hole!

228
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,180
Let's do this, Filo!

229
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,850
Air Strike Shield!

230
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,950
Naofumi-sama!

231
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,200
Hang in there, Shield Hero!

232
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,660
Faster!

233
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,830
Don't let him beat you! Keep running!

234
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,970
We won, right?

235
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,140
Brilliantly done!

236
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,810
Now we can rest easy and focus on rebuilding the village!

237
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,940
If you wanna thank someone, thank Filo.

238
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,290
You cheated!

239
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,420
You didn't tell us your filolial was really this massive tub of lard!

240
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,920
But it only transformed after the race was over.

241
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,300
You're the ones who cheated!

242
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,800
Making holes and all that!

243
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,220
Holes?

244
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,680
Do you have any proof?

245
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,010
The Shield Hero is right.

246
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,060
We detected traces of magic on the course.

247
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,520
I-It was that criminal, obviously!

248
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,780
No. The Shield Hero's magic affinities are healing and support.

249
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,110
His raccoon friend's are light and dark.

250
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,780
Completely different types than the magic we found.

251
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,410
When did they learn so much about us?

252
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,120
It's clear that the Spear Hero's party cheated.

253
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,000
F-Fine! We shall leave for today!

254
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,750
I let you win today,

255
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,880
but it won't happen next time!

256
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,880
In the first place, this fatso...

257
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,090
Is your crotch okay?

258
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,340
Naofumi-sama!

259
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,970
A-Anyway, just you wait! I'll get you yet!

260
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,940
Get well soon.

261
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,030
Sir Hero, again, thank you so much.

262
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,610
We don't know how to express our gratitude for everything you've done.

263
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,410
Forget that. Hand over the reward.

264
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,710
We're going around the village collecting money now.

265
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,290
Please give us a few days...

266
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,580
I don't want money.

267
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,210
Sir Hero!

268
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,590
I don't want rumors spreading about how I took all your rebuilding funds.

269
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,970
Nobody in this village would ever say that!

270
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,140
Really, now?

271
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,060
But then, what else can we give you?

272
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,120
S-Sorry, Naofumi-sama,

273
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,080
but could we stop for a bit?

274
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,980
Sorry to make you do this after you let me rest on the way.

275
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,310
We'll mostly be traveling by carriage now.

276
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,070
You should try to get over your motion sickness.

277
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,190
I'll try.

278
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,610
Your face is a little red.

279
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,660
Do you have a fever?

280
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,110
No.

281
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,080
Filo looks happy now that she gets to draw a carriage.

282
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,200
She sure does.

283
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,340
Are you interested in becoming a traveling trader, Sir Hero?

284
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,420
A traveling trader?

285
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,800
If so, this pass will come in handy.

286
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,300
It exempts you from tolls across the country,so you can traverse the roads as you wish.

287
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,640
We can run a traveling business while fighting monsters and leveling up.

288
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,850
Sounds good.

289
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,850
I'll do my best, too.

290
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,230
Just sleep for tonight.

291
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,980
I'll keep watch.

292
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,400
Okay.

293
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,320
Filo?

294
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,290
Your feathers are stuffy as hell, you know.

295
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,040
Meanie!

296
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,840
Naofumi-sama... Naofumi-sama!

297
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,350
Sorry, I must've fallen asleep.

298
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,850
Huh?

299
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,490
Th-That girl...

300
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,340
Good morning, Master.

301
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,390
Ma—?!

302
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,710
Who the heck is she?!

303
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,330
How would I know?!

304
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,390
I'm hungry!

305
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,010
{\fad(356,1)}A New Comrade

306
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,010
