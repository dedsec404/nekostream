1
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,600
Hyakkimaru got injured due to the sudden return of his hearing.

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,230
A girl named Mio took him in.

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,320
Mio lived with children who had been orphaned in the war.

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,950
But on the night Hyakkimaru went out to fight a demon...

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,540
I can't... I can't believe it.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,750
Huh, what's that?

7
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,460
Bro?

8
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,630
What happened?

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,090
Perfect, help me out here.

10
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,800
Are you okay?

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,140
His leg!

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,060
He shouldn't have fought with that injury. The demon got it.

13
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,230
Does it hurt?

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,980
Huh? That voice...

15
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,650
Yes, he lost his leg but got his voice back.

16
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,780
Hyakkimaru's voice...?

17
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,120
Party is over

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,330
But I still wanna dance

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,050
I can't even sleep

20
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,140
Someday, one day my passion's fire will

21
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,640
From the beginning I knew

22
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,270
One day the flames would die out

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,190
Hey, I thought I didn't need anything

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,690
But even now, I'm so serious

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,120
Ah... I still have time to make it

26
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,370
Ah... but I'm gonna burn it up, baby

27
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,330
Sorry darling, it's not that easy

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,040
But surely it's not that bad either

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,670
Give me fire

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,630
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

31
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,150
Party is over

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,990
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,820
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it

34
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,700
Give me fire

35
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,960
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,960
#6 The story of the Moriko Song, part 2

37
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,390
Mio!

38
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,800
You're home.

39
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,050
Hi there.

40
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,430
Ow...

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,140
What did you do? You're hurt.

42
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,190
It's nothing, I just tripped.

43
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,360
Are you okay? You need to rest up.

44
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,280
I told you that you shouldn't work at both camps.

45
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,320
Stop going...

46
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,740
What's that?

47
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,290
Oh. Well, you see...

48
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,420
Hyakkimaru!

49
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,670
What happened?

50
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,220
It won't kill him.

51
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,390
It was just too early for him to fight.

52
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,180
Mio, never mind him. Get some sleep.

53
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,560
It's okay, I'm used to this.

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,270
You get food ready for everyone.

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,460
Dammit!

56
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,470
What, shouldn't you be keeping watch over your guy?

57
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,130
Yeah...

58
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,970
But Mio will take good care of him.

59
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,640
Jeez, Mio sure likes to take care of people.

60
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,650
After working all night.

61
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,070
Take, have you ever seen your sis at work?

62
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,280
I always stay home.

63
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,610
Can't leave the little ones alone.

64
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,620
Right.

65
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,250
I mean, we have to rely on her or we'll all starve to death.

66
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,830
I'm not blaming you or anything.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,250
We all made a promise together to someday own our own rice paddy.

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,750
Rice paddy?

69
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:07,140
It's gonna be all green in the summer and golden in the fall.

70
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,720
Golden, you know?

71
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,260
We'll grow more rice than we can eat.

72
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,020
We've only seen rice paddies burnt by war or dried up by droughts.

73
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,150
But Mio said they all used to be golden.

74
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,950
Let's make our very own rice paddy some day.

75
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,160
Green and golden. And all ours.

76
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,120
I'll be able to work too in a little bit, so Mio won't have to work so hard.

77
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,540
Hey, Take.

78
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,300
Coming.

79
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,300
Don't worry.

80
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,930
War took a lot from us, so let's get it back.

81
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,730
We need a good rain.

82
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,150
Don't worry. We're blessed by rains every year.

83
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,610
See? There are clouds coming up.

84
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,070
Please, Father.

85
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,370
Let me join the army to suppress the Sakai clan.

86
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,330
I'll crush that little domain like it's nothing.

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,460
Never underestimate wars.

88
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,170
If that's how you think, it's too early for you. Back to your training.

89
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,970
-Father! -Tahomaru.

90
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,220
Mother.

91
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,020
Mother, please tell Father to let me go to war.

92
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,150
Your father just said no.

93
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,730
Then no it is, no matter what I say.

94
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,150
Father doesn't understand!

95
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,400
If only he'd let me go,

96
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,620
I know I'd distinguish myself in battle and make you proud.

97
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,240
Of all things...

98
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,540
My feats wouldn't impress you?

99
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,250
That's not what I mean.

100
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,000
No, you are always like that, Mother.

101
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,380
No matter what prize I hunt down or how great I am at martial arts,

102
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,420
you never care.

103
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,430
I just...

104
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,140
I do not like things to do with war.

105
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,850
It is not war you do not like, but me.

106
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,640
How can you say that?

107
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,270
Tahomaru, what mother would not love her child?

108
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,540
Hyogo, Mutsu. I wish to go riding. Bring the horses.

109
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,330
Young Master!

110
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,800
You don't have to say it. I was being a bit childish.

111
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,800
A bit?

112
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,430
Her lady is kind. Especially to you, always.

113
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,260
I heard you already!

114
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,810
Mother has never been unkind to me. Yet...

115
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,730
Young Master, please, that is dangerous!

116
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,320
You shall get hurt!

117
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,570
Hyogo, Mutsu, help him down!

118
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,070
Mother, look at me!

119
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,490
-Please, Young Master! -Do come down!

120
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,500
Young Master!

121
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,460
Please, you mustn't be up there!

122
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,790
Do you hear me?

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,510
There is something else that Mother cares for much more in this world.

124
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,300
She will never say it, but she is hiding something.

125
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,600
Not just Mother. It's the same for Father, too.

126
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,980
You, I, this domain. We all sit atop a small cornerstone.

127
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,860
Please do not forget that.

128
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,360
What can they be hiding?

129
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Hyakkimaru!

130
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,640
You must stay put.

131
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,940
You mustn't go. I understand that you're frustrated, but what if you die?

132
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,700
I pushed myself too hard as well, so I get it.

133
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm so stupid.

134
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,870
I knew it wasn't easy to make money.

135
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,250
No, no.

136
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,010
I'd already promised I'd never cry because of a samurai ever again.

137
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,380
You too. If you try too hard and die, you lose.

138
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,050
Anyways, I heard you found your voice.

139
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,890
That's amazing. Try to say something.

140
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,440
Is your voice too loud for you?

141
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,480
Really.

142
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,650
You'll get used to it.

143
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,870
Dororo said you were like a beast in a cave the way you are now.

144
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,290
How about a song? You like songs, right?

145
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,750
Pick a red flower

146
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,590
I sing whenever I feel sad.

147
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,680
Instead of crying.

148
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:47,020
Pick a red flower

149
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,480
To give to her

150
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,440
In her hair

151
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,030
I will put the flower

152
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,030
You're leaving?

153
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,910
Yes, just like that girl says, I'll take it slowly.

154
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,790
I'll just go around the place the monster is. I'm in no hurry anyway.

155
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,260
Although it'd be useless to try and tell Hyakkimaru that.

156
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,260
Why's that?

157
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,100
If you take a toy from a baby, it'll get mad and take it back.

158
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,260
Same as that.

159
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,980
Especially since what they took from him is his own body.

160
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,650
He's calm when he's listening to that song.

161
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,480
What do you mean?

162
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,320
The demon flames Hyakkimaru has had since he was a baby.

163
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,370
You could say they're the embers left from when they took his body.

164
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,540
You better hope the beast that comes out of the cave isn't a monster.

165
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,040
Bye now.

166
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,460
...white flower

167
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,510
Don't look at me so much.

168
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,270
You can see people's souls, right? The colors of them.

169
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,770
Please don't look at mine.

170
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,520
It's probably filthy. Really filthy.

171
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,570
How strange. I don't loathe these hands.

172
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,080
Lord Daigo is angry.

173
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,870
So no provisions?

174
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,330
He'll send them. Reinforcements, too.

175
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,420
But it would be an embarrassment to wait.

176
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,050
We will plan a surprise attack. Don't let them sense it.

177
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,390
Tell everyone to be on the watch for Sakai spies.

178
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,970
Yes, sir!

179
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,730
Going to work?

180
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,020
Oh, you know what my job is...

181
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,900
I didn't look on purpose!

182
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,780
It's okay, I'm not ashamed about it.

183
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,240
It's to survive.

184
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,750
But I understand if you want to keep your distance.

185
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,500
It's not a nice job.

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,130
But I'm amazed at how a boy your age understood what my job was.

187
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,300
I traveled around with my mama a lot.

188
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:33,520
And that's the only job Mama didn't do no matter how hungry we got.

189
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,640
What an admirable mama.

190
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,230
But Mama...

191
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,860
That's how she died...

192
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,910
Mama was admirable, but so are you for staying alive.

193
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,370
You are, darn it!

194
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,750
You're gonna take back what war took from you, right?

195
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,670
Then take it all! Rice paddies, farms, everything!

196
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,880
I will. Thanks.

197
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,610
Here, eat up.

198
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,700
Come on, it'll make you stronger.

199
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,990
So what if you lost a leg?

200
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,750
You got your voice back, so say something.

201
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,040
Come on, you need to eat if you want to use that voice.

202
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,000
Here, have some water.

203
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,470
Sorry.

204
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,680
Hey, Hyakkimaru?

205
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,930
You won't lose to it, will you?

206
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,980
You'll never become a monster, right?

207
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,570
Anyways, eat up now.

208
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,710
Pick a red flower

209
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:27,840
To give to her

210
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,840
In her...

211
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,840
Oh, wow!

212
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,850
That's so cool.

213
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,980
I'm going to work, but don't let Hyakkimaru go to fight it.

214
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,230
His body isn't ready for it.

215
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,350
I know.

216
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,780
That's so cool. It's stuck on your arm?

217
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,360
But we've got something cool, too.

218
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,580
We found them at the battlefield.

219
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,880
Look, pretty nice, huh?

220
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,940
Mama...

221
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,120
Hyakkimaru!

222
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,920
Seems like the rain's coming. Finally!

223
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,220
Mio, we're in trouble!

224
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,350
Hyakkimaru went to beat the monster!

225
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,680
Dororo went after him!

226
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,480
Hyakkimaru!

227
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,330
That's it? Give me a break!

228
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,010
Jeez, how could you go without telling me?

229
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,060
Mio is worried, too!

230
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,020
But good thing your leg grew back.

231
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,940
What's wrong?

232
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,440
The temple...!

233
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,740
Check for any more survivors.

234
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,830
What the heck...?

235
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
What's going on?

236
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,170
Who are you? Are you one of them too?

237
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:00,470
This girl came to do lewd business at our camp.

238
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,640
But we saw her enter the Sakai camp last night.

239
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,270
She's been disposed of for being a suspected spy.

240
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,770
Mio, Take!

241
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,150
Let go, idiot! How could you...!

242
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,650
I see you're one of them, too.

243
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,710
Who are you?

244
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,380
His arms...

245
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,510
Mio, wake up! Take!

246
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,510
Pick a red flower

247
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,520
Mio...

248
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,270
To give to her

249
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,400
Kill him!

250
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,410
What the...

251
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,200
You devil...!

252
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,960
No, Hyakkimaru...

253
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,570
You better hope the beast that comes out of the cave isn't a monster.

254
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,030
Spare me, please, I beg you...

255
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,750
Stop it, Hyakkimaru, stop!

256
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,170
Don't! You can't turn into a monster!

257
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,630
Please bro, come on!

258
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,890
Hyakkimaru, Mio had this with her.

259
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,310
It's seed rice.

260
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,230
She really got it back from the samurai.

261
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,270
To make her own rice paddy.

262
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,020
She didn't lose.

263
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,780
So you can't lose either.

264
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,780
Please...

265
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,370
Mi... o...

266
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,390
Here.

267
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,440
Pick a red flower

268
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,200
To give to her

269
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,000
In her hair

270
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:23,340
I will put the flower

271
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,940
Sorrow scatters in the wind,

272
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,740
piling up to form shadows

273
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:55,450
Our footsteps admonish indifference in such verbose ways

274
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:02,000
As I peek into your fathomless eyes, I lose my composure

275
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,970
Is there any hope in the place I am heading to?

276
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,220
I feign amusement and laugh

277
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,510
because this road is so dark

278
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,230
I will be there to shine the light

279
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,730
I'm used to playing at saying goodbye,

280
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,860
but I cried when I waved to you

281
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,160
Our fiery woes fade... and fade... until night falls upon us

282
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,660
If I knew tomorrow would be so mundane,

283
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,870
I wouldn't have said that I wanted to live

284
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,760
I know it's futile but can't help dreaming of a future... a future... you are to blame

285
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,930
"Arijigoku"
