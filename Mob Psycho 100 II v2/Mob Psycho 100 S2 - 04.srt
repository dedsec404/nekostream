1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,970
Here comes another psychic.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,010
What should we do with them, Dimple-san?

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,860
Probably just another fake.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,270
Get 'em to scram.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,270
Oh, shit...

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,000
He's...

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,000
the real deal!

8
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,130
Mob Psycho

9
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,010
Inside~Evil Spirit~

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,970
This job we just got is huge!

11
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,190
Cup Curry

12
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,930
I still don't know the details,

13
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,190
but the client is a famously wealthy fellow.

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,850
We're talking super rich.

15
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,700
He'll even pay for our taxi.

16
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,340
And yet we're taking a train?

17
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,910
So is this rich person the president of a company or something?

18
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,330
He is.

19
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,410
How can one person own a house like this?

20
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,340
Get a load of all these shady-looking people.

21
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,300
They're probably from the same field.

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,800
Hey, you two.

23
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,140
Shinra Banshomaru-san.

24
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,830
What the heck are you doing here?

25
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,600
Right back at you.

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,060
Shinra-kun.

27
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,200
Jodo-sama!

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,900
Jodo KirinRising Sun Spiritual Union President

29
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,280
Who is that man?

30
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,120
He helped me with getting rid of an evil spirit once.

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,120
This is Reigen Arataka, a freelance psychic.

32
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,970
Ah, so this is the man...

33
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,190
The one who's been lying aboutgetting rid of the Dragger?

34
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,460
Pleased to meet ya.

35
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,160
So that's Jodo?

36
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,270
Avoid eye contact!

37
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,920
What a creepy geezer!

38
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,510
It's them!

39
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,600
Having a rough time trying\h\hto get into the psychic biz\h\h

40
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,600
Former Upper Echelon Member of\h\h\h\h\h\h\hClaw's Seventh DivisionMatsuo

41
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,600
Are they going to get in my way again?But I'm running a legit business now!

42
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,870
Here he comes.

43
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,810
It's the client.

44
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,160
I thank all of you professionals for gathering here today.

45
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,780
Asagiri Holdings (Ltd.) CEOAsagiri Masashi

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,780
I have no doubts that you are all true psychics.

47
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,220
But whether any of you can save my daughteris a different matter entirely.

48
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,440
I ask that you keep whatyou're about to see a secret.

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,030
This is my daughter, Asagiri Minori. She's fourteen years old.

50
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,750
She is behind a one-way mirror, so she cannot see us.

51
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,210
She's the same age as Mob.

52
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,210
He has her locked up?

53
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,670
Isn't that going too far?

54
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,390
At first, I didn't believe in spirits, either.

55
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,790
But no matter how many counselors or mental health professionals we saw,

56
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,060
there was no improvement.

57
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,400
She's been possessed by an evil spirit.

58
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,030
I'd like for you all to rid her of it.

59
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,240
What do you think?

60
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,760
Right now, I'm not sensing anything.

61
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,480
It's probably some mental disorder stemming from adolescence.

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,370
I do sense a faint sinister presence though...

63
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,830
And extremely nearby.

64
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,820
No price is too high!

65
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,790
I will have a special reward for whoever saves my daughter!

66
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,630
Very well.

67
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,150
Guess we'll take care of thisin a jiffy once again.

68
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,100
What do you say, Mob? I'll be sure to give you a bonus.

69
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,240
A bonus... That's a first.

70
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,480
You've been underpaid this whole time.

71
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,230
Hold it! You're not going to steal the march on us!

72
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,190
Namu

73
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,190
Namu

74
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,920
Who said you could decide?!

75
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,190
No fair!

76
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,190
Let me do it!

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,680
Everyone, please, calm down.

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,910
How about we do rock-paper-scissors to decide?

79
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,170
Huh? Rock-paper-scissors?

80
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,170
I guess that's fair.

81
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:12,900
Sure.

82
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,500
Yeah.

83
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,420
All right, I'm gonna throw paper.

84
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,090
Huh?

85
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,800
Why are you telling us that?

86
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,330
Actually, I think I'll go with scissors.

87
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,590
Uh, no, really...

88
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,300
Leave him be. That's just how he is.

89
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,870
So is he going to throw paper or scissors?

90
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,320
First comes rock!

91
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,760
Rock, paper,

92
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,070
scissors!

93
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,120
Reigen emerged victorious.

94
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,440
Wow, how did you do that?

95
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,400
Psychological Warfare

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,400
Observation

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,400
Line of Sight

98
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,400
Their Hand Angles

99
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,400
Scan their arms

100
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,400
Etc.

101
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,030
I will never lose to anyone in rock-paper-scissors.

102
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,980
See ya, losers.

103
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,280
I never should've said I knew him.

104
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,490
Please save my daughter.

105
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,350
I've got it.

106
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,650
I can't provide the professional help she needs.Not on our first meeting, at that.

107
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,880
All I can do here isapproach this as a psychic.

108
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,440
Hello there.

109
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,340
Yes, like I always do.

110
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,280
Do you know why you're locked in here?

111
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,690
I don't...

112
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,210
There's something wrong with Papa lately.

113
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,600
With your father?

114
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,570
Lately, he's locked me up in here,strapped me down onto this bed,

115
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,860
started glaring at me,and even hit me sometimes.

116
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,030
That's notâ€”I mean,I didn't hit her hard...

117
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,620
He's even brought around a bunch of adults

118
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,750
and had them touch me all overwith their filthy, filthy hands.

119
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,040
Th-That's preposterous!

120
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,250
You can't believe a word Dad says.

121
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,190
He's been acting so darn crazy lately,like he's possessed.

122
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,460
How so?

123
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,480
He started saying that I've been cursed,

124
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,220
or that my body's been taken over by a demon.

125
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,850
I mean, I guess I was acting a little rebellious,

126
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,190
but this is going way too far.

127
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,290
I-I assure you that I'm sane!

128
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,520
This is ridiculous!

129
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,320
There's a demon that's making my daughter say these lies!

130
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,780
Am I going to be trapped in here forever?

131
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,410
Say, Mr. Psychic...

132
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,560
could ya undo these for me?

133
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,370
They hurt so bad!

134
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,270
I'll ask your dad.

135
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,740
How'd it go?

136
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,840
This is an open-and-shut case.

137
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,510
She is perfectly normal.

138
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,030
You think so too, Jodo-sama?

139
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,310
What? What do you mean?

140
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,070
We're saying that there's zero possibility that she's possessed.

141
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,730
No, that can't be true!

142
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,300
It's my turn next. But I'm rather certain Jodo-sama is correct.

143
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,190
But waitâ€”

144
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,450
Are you sure you're not the problem here?

145
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,700
You don't like the change in yourrelationship and refuse to accept it.

146
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,490
Instead, you're blaming spirits and demons.

147
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,240
N-No...

148
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,140
Is that really how you guystalk to a client?

149
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,280
That's a nasty one.

150
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,200
Definitely something wrong there.

151
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,910
It didn't feel like I was talking to a child.

152
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,830
So you believe me?

153
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,010
You just want the reward money all to yourself, don't you?

154
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,510
Everyone who actually fell for what she said should leave now.

155
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,520
She's just going to make a fool of you.

156
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,270
The way she talked was too inconsistent.

157
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,430
And she switched from "Papa" to "Dad."

158
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,270
Also, I never introduced myself,

159
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,700
but she called me a psychic.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,820
Meaning she heard our conversation out hâ€”

161
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,930
Udo! Are you all right?!

162
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,950
Get a hold of yourself!

163
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,270
Sh-She's a monster...

164
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,760
Master!

165
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,310
I'm fine.

166
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,890
More importantly, she sure showed her true colors pretty fast.

167
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,440
I guess there's no point in continuing this charade.

168
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,470
Go ahead and try to force meout of this girl!

169
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,560
I beg of you! Somebody please save my daughter!

170
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,560
I will pay you anything if you can rid my daughter of that demon!

171
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,990
Two hundred million!Five hundred million!

172
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,990
Yawn

173
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,450
Lick Lick Lick

174
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,370
Namu

175
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Here I go! I'm gonna drink it!

176
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,670
I'm getting bored of this.

177
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,390
Your turn might be coming up soon.

178
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,090
Winner

179
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,090
49th out of 68

180
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,960
Make sure you warm up a bit.

181
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,090
You're making it sound like a workout.

182
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,550
There are no warmups for this.

183
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:46,020
Suikoden

184
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,820
What's wrong, Dimple? You're shaking like crazy.

185
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,200
Are you a chihuahua?

186
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,490
There's still time... Drop this job!

187
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,020
Huh?

188
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,480
I'm sure you've at least heard of his name before... Mogami Keiji.

189
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,000
Nope.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,940
Mogami...

191
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,970
He's one of the people I referenced when I first started in this biz.

192
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,700
He's been dead for ages, though.

193
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,280
We're talking about forty years ago!

194
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,740
40 Years Ago

195
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,240
Mogami Keiji

196
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,240
Mogami Keiji.

197
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,750
Mogami Keiji performs a seance

198
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,240
He was known as a good psychic who usedseances and channeling to save people,

199
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,710
Mogami Keiji

200
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:13,710
The voices of the dead

201
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
and the media loved him.

202
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,300
But what the masses were seeingwas Mogami Keiji the entertainer.

203
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,010
PsychicMogami Keiji

204
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,550
And then one day,

205
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,910
he completely vanished from the public eye.

206
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,140
Mogami had another side to him.

207
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,350
He was an assassinwho used his powers to kill.

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,810
Mogami was desperate for money.

209
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,090
His mother was gravely ill,

210
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,220
and the treatment and equipmentshe needed cost a lot of money.

211
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,990
Be it the living or the dead, seeing theirfinal moments had become routine for him.

212
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,160
And it broke him.

213
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,210
And that's around the time

214
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,840
he showed up to exorcise me.

215
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,800
How dare you do that to my followers?!

216
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,410
I'm going full power for this!

217
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,930
Overrun! Wraither Beam!

218
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,020
I give up!

219
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,890
Wait, I said I give up! I won't do anything bad ever again!

220
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,450
What are you talking about?

221
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,490
You seem to have the wrong idea.

222
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,330
I've come to absorb you.

223
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,040
A-Absorb me?

224
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,540
This bastard...

225
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,040
He's human, but he's absorbing my spiritual molecules!

226
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,140
Are you trying to eat me?

227
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,880
You'll just end up with an upset stomach!

228
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,880
I am going to willfullyshuffle off this mortal coil soon

229
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,840
and become a powerful vengeful spirit.

230
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,000
Shit! This bastard's completely lost it!

231
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,310
Wh-Why would you do that?

232
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,190
Revenge.

233
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm going to show all those bastards whothink nothing bad will ever happen to them.

234
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,130
Show them what true hatred is like.

235
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,500
And what happens when theymanipulate and use someone.

236
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,280
You're going to empower meto achieve that goal.

237
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,190
It appears I absorbed too many vengeful spirits at once.

238
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,960
It got away?

239
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,420
Hang on a sec.

240
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,130
What's that got to do with anything?

241
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,700
That's Mogami himself!

242
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,500
The star psychic of the 20th century,Mogami Keiji!

243
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,010
Or what's become of him.

244
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,020
Please... spare... me...

245
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,230
Goodbye.

246
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,080
As I figured, this is all you're worth.

247
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,930
You're all so weak,

248
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,990
I have no reason to let you live!

249
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,910
How sad.

250
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,870
Apparently, it's finally my time to shine.

251
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,120
It's a shame that I'm so bad at rock-paper-scissors.

252
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,670
Are you supposed to be a famous psychic?I don't recognize you.

253
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,520
Please... God...

254
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,500
Begone... foul spirit!

255
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,700
Jodo-sama's getting serious!

256
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,850
This will be enlightening!

257
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,560
He's not even bothering with chants or throwing salt around, huh?

258
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,070
Que?

259
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,690
Hey, something's wrong.

260
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,570
Did he get possessed?

261
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,780
That's it?

262
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,010
Hey, explain something to me.

263
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,540
What makes this guy such a big shot?

264
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,590
Here he comes.

265
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,540
Run, Shigeo!

266
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,790
Anti-Possession Jumping Knee Strike!

267
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,060
A jumping knee strike to knocka possessed person unconscious.

268
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:48,760
Anti-Possession Jumping Knee Strike

269
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,760
This is one of Reigen's special attacks.

270
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,830
Jodo-sama!

271
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,790
Sorry!

272
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,100
Hey, evil spirit!

273
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,730
If my intuition's correct, you're actually Mogami Keiâ€”

274
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,270
You know who I am?

275
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,310
Damn, it was true?!

276
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,180
Why the hell are you possessing that girl?

277
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,470
Were you into young girls when you were aliveâ€”

278
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,780
T-Time out...

279
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,490
He's not stopping!

280
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,700
Minori.

281
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,290
Stop this.

282
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,660
I'll stay by your side.

283
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,090
Get awa...

284
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,550
He impaled him!

285
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,030
You can't... be serious...

286
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,690
I didn't come here to see someone die!

287
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,230
We can't deal with that monster!

288
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,980
Run!

289
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,720
I-It won't open?!

290
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,720
No way!

291
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,690
Let us out!

292
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,150
Where do you think you're going?

293
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,490
Well, this has gone to shit.

294
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,290
Mob, you warmed up yet?

295
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,870
Yes.

296
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,680
Well, I'm not actually warmed up at all,

297
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,260
but I know I have to deal with this anyway.

298
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,500
ProgressTowardsMob'sExplosion

299
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,000
Mob Psycho

300
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,510
Mob Psycho

301
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,560
A demon...

302
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,470
Shouldn't we run away?

303
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,140
I'm pretty confident in my abilities.

304
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,770
Spirit Hold!

305
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,130
Oh?

306
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,570
I don't know who it is, but someone'sgot some decent telekinetic powers.

307
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,270
It's true that humans can't movetheir joints past a certain point.

308
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,520
But what about a doll's joints?

309
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,710
Oh, look. I can move.

310
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,990
That girl's body...

311
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,430
Get it now?

312
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,430
Nothing you do to this body will affect me.It's not a solution.

313
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,890
What are you laughing about?

314
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,350
It's him.

315
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,400
There is a solution.

316
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,820
I'll make you disappear.

317
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,660
Now we're talking!

318
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,280
Such incredible spiritual power...

319
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,200
What the hell is that?

320
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,550
I've never seen anything like it!

321
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,380
Get out of Minori-san... Now!

322
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,890
Amazing...

323
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,340
I thought he was just some kid,

324
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,960
but he's insanely powerful!

325
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,180
Forget being possessed! They're fusing into one now!

326
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,690
I messed up...

327
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,410
Master, the situation's gotten even worse.

328
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,280
You're telling me he's stronger than you, Mob?

329
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Yes.

330
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,060
No way...

331
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,160
That bastard... He's even livelier nowthan when he was alive!

332
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,620
You done, kid?

333
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,830
Now's our only chance!

334
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
That bastard actually did it.

335
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,650
He became the most powerful evil spirit...

336
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,490
Well, if you die and can't pass on, at least we'll have each other.

337
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,000
Don't even joke about that!

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,040
I see.

339
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,560
I can go inside of Minori-sanand expel the evil spirit from within.

340
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,900
Are you stupid?!

341
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,810
How's a human like you going to enter another human?!

342
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,970
With an out of body experience.

343
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,550
I see...

344
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,770
But during that time, your body will be completely defenseless.

345
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,950
Not to mention her body will resist you!

346
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,440
But I have no other choice.

347
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,420
Dimple, could you possess my body for a while and protect it?

348
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,370
Say what?

349
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,480
No, no! Anything but that, Mob!

350
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,340
If you let him in,he'll probably never leave.

351
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,300
You know what you're signing up for, right?

352
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,220
Are you seriously going to trust Dimple?

353
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,810
I'm sure it'll be fine.

354
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,570
First, I need to lose consciousness.

355
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,730
Concentrate...

356
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,840
Has he changed a little?

357
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,990
Or wait... Is he trying to change himself?

358
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Whoa!

359
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,950
Holy shit! Even I can see it!

360
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,540
He's coming!

361
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,750
Take that!

362
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,090
Wait a sec!

363
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,970
It's no use... I can't move.

364
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,430
If you don't need this body anymore,why don't I take it off your hands?

365
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,600
You dumbass.

366
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,060
It belongs to me now!

367
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,020
That's what you get!

368
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,320
Whoa there!

369
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,150
I'm not gonna let you break my precious body that easily!

370
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,200
Why's there another spirit? What a nuisance.

371
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,410
Begone.

372
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,200
Now, Shigeo!

373
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,220
So that's your game...

374
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,880
You must be insane.

375
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,840
Yeah, he's not a normal kid.

376
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,030
Go...

377
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,560
I know you can... win...

378
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,680
Welcome.

379
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,410
Is your sense of self still intact?

380
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,230
If you'd made one misstep getting in here,your soul would've been destroyed.

381
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,690
Please leave this body.

382
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,290
You didn't come here to talk, did you?

383
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,800
Correct, but you seem so human.

384
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,130
We're currently in a mental world.

385
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,910
It mirrors the way we see ourselves.

386
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,960
I'm Mogami Keiji, a former psychic.

387
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,660
How about we have a little contest?

388
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,250
A barrier, eh?

389
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,370
Very impressive.

390
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,390
Mind showing me a little more?

391
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,810
He's got his evil spirit face on now.

392
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,090
Such power...

393
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,160
You've truly been blessed... with incredible power...

394
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,120
That's a ghost... An evil spirit...

395
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
By the way, young man...

396
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,660
Do you know where spiritual power or ESP comes from?

397
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,130
Sorry, but I don't have any more time.

398
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,130
I'm going to finish you now.

399
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,850
Your emotions.

400
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,050
It all comes from your emotions.

401
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,750
The biggest distinguishing feature of humansis how rich and varied their emotions are.

402
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,700
These emotions are the reason they thriveand also the reason they fight.

403
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,050
Huh? My powers...

404
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,990
You can't use ESP anymore.

405
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,760
I was gauging how youpicture your powers earlier.

406
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,030
Quite impressive.

407
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,700
All kinds of emotionsare raging inside of you.

408
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,800
But for some reason,you willingly play the part of a puppet.

409
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,280
Please... leave...

410
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,830
You still don't get the fact that you fell into a trap?

411
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,570
I let you in on purpose.

412
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,300
Now, here's the million-dollar question.

413
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,420
People whose lives are filled with happiness,and people who live in eternal suffering...

414
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,640
Which do you think harborstrong emotions more easily?

415
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,840
The answer is the latter.

416
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,400
Negative feelings are much more powerful.

417
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,360
The more stressed someone is,the richer the energy they hold within.

418
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,660
Going by that, there's room formore drastic change in you.

419
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,620
All you need is a slight change in how you see the world.

420
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,740
Want me to help you out?

421
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,090
It's morning...

422
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,350
Kageyama Shigeo.

423
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,220
Here, you're a normal middle schooler.

424
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,350
I altered your memories a bit, and made it so you can't use ESP.

425
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,980
A change in perspective can makethe world a whole different place.

426
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,620
With that in mind, I'll be observinghow you act without your powers.

427
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,700
Huh? What was I doing again?

428
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,120
I was doing something important...

429
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,670
But I can't remember it at all.

430
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,390
Oh, I should hurry up and get to school.

431
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,460
Next time on Mob Psycho 100 II Episode 5:

432

433
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,190
