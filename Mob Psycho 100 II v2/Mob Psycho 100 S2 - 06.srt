If they're going to get in the way of your exorcism job, get rid of them!

They don't actually care about you.

154

They're just having fun mocking someone as wimpy as you.

But then again...

172
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,910
He shouldn't have anyone he can talk to about his problems other than me.

That's fine and all,but what brought this on?

180
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,520
They had a fight. He cut ties with him.

181
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,870
That's not it. But I gave it a lot of thought and made my decision.

182
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,670
I've been blindly following whatMaster Reigen says way too often.

183
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,930
I felt like things went better that way,so it was easier for me.

But...

185

Grow up, for crying out loud.

186
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,510
I realized that I can't justkeep relying on him,

187
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,080
so I thought I'd reconsider what I want to do a bit more.

Apparently, that's enough for them to respect me.

But I didn't even put any alcohol in it...

387

388
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,220

391

It's not something we can handle.

392
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,570
Our spiritual power can't do anything inside a game.

then beat the crap out of him.

{\an8}The pleasure's all mine.

450
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,940
Holy crap... I'm actually on TV.

451
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,690
Everything's going so smoothly.

452
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,100

Come on, now...

456
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,860
If I actually pull this off like a rock star on national TV,

457
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,020
maybe I'll get even more fans...

458
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,920
All right. I'm nervous, but I'm going to show them what I've got!

459
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,600
{\an8}"...nervous, but I'm going to show them what I've got!" is what you're thinking, isn't it?

460
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,340
That ego of yours is going to deflate soon enough, you fool!

461
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,800
I'm the one who mentioned you to one of the TV station's producers!

462
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,810
My disciples told me about what happened that day!

They told me how you had the nerve to nail me with a jumping knee strike!

465
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,850
I'm going to make you pay dearly!

466
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,230
I'll make damn sure you regret what you've done!

467
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,670

The blu-rays? An even better decision.

474
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,210
