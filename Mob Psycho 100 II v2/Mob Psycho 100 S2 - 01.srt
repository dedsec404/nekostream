NamuAmidaButsu

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,340
Believe it or not, the world isfilled with strange phenomena

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,550
that science is yet to explain.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,720
And when people come face to face with them,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,280
they are helplessly throwninto the dark depths of fear.

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,400
But there are those who fight every day

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,510
to shine a ray of hope into that chaotic darkness.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,700
People call them...

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,210
Psychics

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,150
Psychics.

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,190
There's no doubt about it...

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,470
What I saw was not of this world.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,050
I knew there was somethingwrong with this property

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,860
since I bought it dirt cheap.

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,930
I've never been the type toworry about stuff like that.

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,330
But fields are at their most vulnerablein the days leading up to a harvest.

17
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,940
So I got worried one night,

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,690
went to check on things,and that's when I saw it.

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,150
Something was wriggling back and forth,dancing on my fields!

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,280
The next morning, I foundall of my crops withered away.

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,400
I only started farming to kill time,but this has been going on for three years.

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:12,750
Amino Acid FertilizerPotting Compost

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,750
It's starting to creep me out now.

24
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,010
My next harvest is coming up, so that's why I gave you a call.

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,320
I figured I needed the help of someone with psychic powers.

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,470
A wise decision, sir.

27
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,830
But, you see...

28
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,850
Next year, my idiot son will be starting high school, so...

29
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,490
As for your fees...

30
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,980
You don't think you can pay?

31
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,440
It would depend on how much, but...

32
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,470
Well, I am running a business here,

33
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,690
so I'm going to needsome form of compensation.

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,610

37
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,610
Right...

38
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,240
Let's see. If I'm able to exorcise whatever it is that's haunting your fields...

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,500
I'll take 30 percent of your upcoming harvest!

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,960
He's okay with veggies as payment?

41
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,670
I looked into this a bit on my own,

42
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,670
but I don't see any issueswith the fertilizer or the soil.

43
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,610
Meaning there's not muchI can do about this situation.

44
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,150
What do you think, Mob?

45
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,350
Again, could you not summon meon such short notice?

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,710
This could be the work of those daikon fairies.

47
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,310
Do those even exist?

48
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,410
Did you see something move just now?

49
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,730
Actually...

50
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,270
It's rather weak, but I do sense an aura.

51
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,700
I heard you yappin' earlier today, too.

52
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,160
You gonna exorcise me?

53
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,580
Mob, let's take care of this quickly.

54
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,330
Okay.

55
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,740
Is that it?

56
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,140
Yes. It was just possessing the scarecrow, so it probably couldn't do much harm.

57
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,480
What the heck is that?

58
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,440
Oh, that would be the spirit's true form.

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,520
So the scarecrow was a decoy?!

60
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,490
High-Level SpiritWriggle Wriggle

61
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,490
This is my land, and I won't let anyone else have it!

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,690
Then show me the deed!

63
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,450
Do you have any idea how hard it isto grow crops until harvest?

64
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,420
Talk about a twisted way to harass someone!

65
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,770
It's not like I'm lettingthe crops go to waste.

66
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,830
Did you actually think that spirits can't eat?

67
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,130
You guys don't need nutrients!

68
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,090
I can absorb the lifeforce of all the cropsthat grow in these fields.

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,230
So don't worry. They're servingtheir purpose as my food.

70
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,560
You wretched vegetable thief...

71
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,110
Mob!

72
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,630
Blast him!

73
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,340
Okay.

74
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,370
Not bad, kid.

75
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,030
But it appears your friend hereis as ordinary as they come.

76
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,410
Master!

77
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,250
I'll turn you both into fertilizer!

78
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,940
It's no use!

79
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,040
What you're destroying is but a tiny portion of the plants I control.

80
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,010
But keep it up, and I'll instantly kill your friend and rip him to pieces!

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,930
You're indeed a child.

82
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,140
How naïve. You should've knownyou were both going to die anyway.

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,530
Since destroying the vinesdoesn't hurt the spirit itself,

84
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,220
it must not be possessing them.

85
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,470
It's controlling living things like a remote control car.

86
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,280
I've never even thought about doing that.

87
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,910
I wonder if I can do it, too...The same thing as an evil spirit.

88
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,250
You brat!

89
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,930
The plants stopped moving?

90
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,890
I tried ordering the plants.

91
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,350
When I sent them a stronger signalthan the evil spirit,

92
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,290
I was able to control them.

93
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,570
That's the correct solution. I'm glad you were able to realize it.

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Curse you, you brat!

95
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,860
How dare you overwritemy command over these plants?!

96
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,370
Damn it... You'll pay for this!

97
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,370
Die!

98
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,170
What?!

99
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,130
Huh?

100
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,970
What is that?

101
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,310
I thought I'd start a home garden.

102
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,190
If it works out, we can save money on food.

103

Spirits and SuchConsultation Office

104
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,150
The veggies we were supposed to get as payment were a bust,

105
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,660
but he gave me some soil, fertilizer, and vegetable seeds instead.

I'm getting paid in kind now...

Thank you very much.

113
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,500
Oh, right.

114
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,460
I planted some cherry tomatoes in here.

115
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,920
Why don't you put some energy into itand see if you can make them grow?

116
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,070
Okay.

117
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,810
Whoa, that's amazing!

118
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,270
I smell a new business opportunity!

It tastes like crap.

Umami 0%

123
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,280
You can take these cherry tomatoes home with you.

124
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,840
Huh?

125
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,510
Huh?

126
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,080
Mob Psycho

127
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,740
Welcome, my fellow upper echelon membersof the Psycho Helmet Religion.

128
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,960
We're Looking For Our God. The Psycho Helmet Religion

129
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,320
Let us begin our twelfth official meeting.

130
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,580
As for today's agenda,

131
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,930
we'll be discussing the head templefor our Psycho Helmet Religion.

132
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,010
Actually, before we get into that,I have a question.

133
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,100
Has there been any progress inthe search for our beloved founder?

134
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,610
He has not been found yet.

135
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,820
Many men have claimed to be the founder,but they were all impostors.

136
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,280
At the (LOL) gathering,

137
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,410
I saw his face up close,so I'm the one verifying these claims.

138
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,370
I can guarantee they are false.

139
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,070
But I promise to bring our founderbefore you very soon.

140
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,670
Yeah, right. I know the kid to begin with.

141
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,490
I'm going to keep riling up these believers

142
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,720
and make Mob-kun a cult star.

143
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,600
But the biggest obstacle hereis Mob-kun himself.

144
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,390
Right now, there's no wayhe could lead anyone.

145
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,940
I need him to grow more as a person.

146
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,520
There has to be a way... Something that'll make Mob-kun grow.

147
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,160
I...

148
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,050
Kamuro Shinji,

149
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,610
hereby resign from my position as student council president as of today.

150
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,730
What?

151
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,960
I spread false rumors about fellow students

152
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,170
and accused them of crimes they didn'tcommit, and that's why I'm resigning.

153
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,550
Therefore, an election for the next student council president will be held very soon.

154
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,830
That's it! This is perfect! Something to help Mob-kun grow!

155
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,980
But there's no reasonMob-kun would want to run.

156
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,670
How do I...

157
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,830
I wonder who the next president is going to be.

158
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,780
Right?

159
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,240
I just hope they're a good person,if nothing else.

160
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,610
Ah, it's Tsubomi-chan.

161
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,830
She's as cute as ever.

162
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,660
You're staring way too hard again.

163
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,610
Mezato-san?!

164
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,870
And you're panicking too much.

165
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,460
So you do like Takane-san.

166
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,590
Wha... How did you...

167
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,420
What's with that reaction?

168
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,090
I never expected you tofall for the school's idol.

169
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,180
I guess even you can be rather superficial, too.

170
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,980
I honestly don't getwhat you see in her, though.

171
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,960
I've been friends with Tsubomi-chansince we were little.

172
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,580
Oh, she's the school's idol?

173
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,690
I see...

174
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,620
How did two childhood friends end up in such drastically different situations?

175
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,100
Under normal circumstances, you'd have no chance with her,

176
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,830
but right now, you have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

177
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,290
What do you mean?

178
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,750
Student Council

179
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,750
The seat of student council president is vacant!

180
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,130
Right now, Takane-san isway out of your league,

181
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,170
but what if you werestudent council president?

182
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,340
Student Council President

183
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,340
You'd go shooting up the ranks!

184
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,430
You might be able to close the gap between you and your school idol!

185
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,330
I wouldn't mind helping you out if you're thinking about running.

186
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,480
You'll owe me one, though.

187
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,940
This is the perfect opportunity to show people who you really are, Mob-kun!

188
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:25,570
Hardcore Training Montage

189
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,780
And on that day, Mob's hardcore training began.

190
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,270
Finally, a week later...

191
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,750
Student Council President Candidate Speech Competition

192
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,620
We will now begin the election to decide our next student council president.

193
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,930
There are a total of four candidates.

194
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,670
Our first candidate isMorishige Kyohei-kun from Class 2-2.

195
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,400
Each candidate gave their speech.

196
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,930
Next, from Class 3-4,

197
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,940
we have Kamuro Shinji-kun.

198
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,450
Wait, why?

199
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,350
Didn't he resign?

200
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,420
President, why did you resign without discussing it with us?

201
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,190
I'm just as responsible for what we did!

202
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,200
Resigning is no way to take responsibility.

203
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,580
You're still running away,which achieves nothing.

204
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,540
Stand for election again,and if you do get elected...

205
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,210
Yeah. That'll be my opportunity to truly make things right.

206
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,180
And finally, Mob's turn arrived.

207
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,550
Nii-san?

208
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,520
What the heck is he doing?

209
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,480
Wait, Mob-kun?

210
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,130
You practiced your speech over and over, not to mention I basically wrote it for you.

211
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,440
You've got this!

212
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,900
Kageyama! It's all about guts!

213
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,060
You pulled a fast one on me,White T Poison.

214
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,610
You're not content with rulingthe school from the shadows?

215
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,060
I was planning on supportingPresident Kamuro,

216
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,330
but this changes everything.

217
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,850
Kageyama Shigeo-kun from Class 2-1.

218
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,450
Please begin.

219
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,460
And it's over.

220
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,650
Each candidate is given five minutes for their campaign speech,

221
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,280
and he was the first person everto not say a single word in that time.

224
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,620
I need him to be better.

225
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,390
I never should've done that.

226
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,260
This one did a number on him.

227
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,720
He's not moving at all.

228
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,970
Go on home for the day, okay?

Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.

232
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,560
I'll be waiting for you behind the school.

233
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,680
W-Wait, this is...

234
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,950
When I saw you muster the courage to takethe podium despite being so uncomfortable,

235
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,780
I ended up falling for you, Kageyama-kun.

236
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,850
Um...

237
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,990
Please go out with me.

Let's walk home together.

249
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,630
Oh, but I have club...

250
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,850
Go on, Kageyama.Today's menu is free training, anyway.

251
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,640
Thank you, Captain Musashi.

252
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,600
Huh?

253
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,770
Mob-kun has a girlfriend?

254
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,310
What's going on? Is this some supernatural phenomenon?

255
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,270
What the heck's happening?

256
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,650
But man, I'm so envious...

257
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,510
So what do you usually do, Kageyama-kun?

258
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,320
Um...

259
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,200
I do some running with the Body Improvement Club.

260
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,540
Other than that, I helpan acquaintance with their work.

261
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,780
What kind of work?

262
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,750
Huh? Oh, ghost—

263
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,880
I-It's sort of like a bookstore.

264
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,210
What? You work part-time at a bookstore, Kageyama-kun?

265
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,010
That's amazing!

266
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,820
N-No, it's not a big deal...

267
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,100
I only help out with really simple things.

268
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,730
Still, it is amazing! I'd love to work at a bookstore.

269
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,470
I'm already lying to her.

270
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,190
But I think telling her I havean exorcism job will creep her out.

271
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,650
You look a little pale. Are you okay?

272
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,020
Yeah. Hey, you like books, Emi-san?

273
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,080
Well... I do like books, but...

274
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,970
I guess I don't mind telling you,Kageyama-kun.

275
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,990
I'm writing a novel.

276
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,500
Huh?

277
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,340
Wow, that's amazing!

278
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,790
What's amazing about that?

279
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,280
Oh, you don't care, huh?

280
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,480
Sorry.

281
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,120
No, I really think it's amazing!

282
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,220
I'm just bad with words.

283
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,310
Maybe I'll have you read it sometime.

284
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,150
I haven't shown anyone else,

285
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,350
so it'd be pretty embarrassing for me.

286
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,850
But this counts as practice, too.

287
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,330
Sure, I'll read it.

288
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,280
And every day after that,Mob walked home from school with Emi.

289
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,760
Hey, Mob. You're home early again.

290
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,870
Did you quit your club?

291
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,810
No, I'm actually heading back to school now.

292
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,330
Huh?

293
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,290
Why the heck did he bother coming home, then?

294
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,310
Hey, Mob. You seem more cheerful than usual today.

295
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,750
You exorcism game is on point, too.

296
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,840
You think so? I can't really tell myself.

297
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,720
Did you get a girlfriend?

298
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,400
As if!

299
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,930
I-I'm done with the exorcism, so I'm going home now.

300
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,790
Bye.

301
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,560
Huh?

302
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,640
What?

303
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,020
What?

304
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,140
Seconds, please.

305
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,570
Wow, this is rare.Our Shige asking for seconds.

306
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,360
What's up, Shigeo? Did you use too much of your psychic powers?

307
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,820
No, it's not like that.

308
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,880
I thought Nii-san would bebummed out about the election,

309
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,770
but I'm glad to see he's more than fine.

310
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,710
One Week Later

311
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,130
Are you done reading?

312
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,830
What do you think?

313
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,030
It's really good... I think.

314
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,800
You know a lot of big words.

315
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,720
If you don't get it, just say so.

316
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,950
Sorry! That's not what I meant!

317
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,980
I really did pay attention to every word!

318
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,520
Say, Kageyama-kun...

319
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,420
It's been a week since I asked you out.

320
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,450
You rejected me then,so why do you still walk home with me?

321
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,420
Is it because you felt bad for me?

322
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,780
Huh? No, it's nothing like that.

323
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,910
I also know you were going back to your club after you got home.

324
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,350
You keep trying not to hurt my feelings.

325
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,660
Are you sure it's not pity? I feel sort of pathetic.

326
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,800
I-I'm sorry. That's not my intention.

327
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,500
And all you do is apologize.

328
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,190
I don't understand how you feel at all.

329
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,430
Or could it be...

330
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,950
that you don't even have feelings?

331
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,830
Huh?

332
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,550
Like, your own opinions.

333
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,560
Your froze up in your campaign speech, too.

334
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,270
Did you only run for presidentbecause someone told you to?

335
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,610
Well...

336
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,660
The truth is, I'm sort of like that, too.

337
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,530
You are?

338
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,290
The reason I asked you out was because of a dare.

339
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,950
We thought your silent speech was hilarious,

340
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,380
so my friends and I played rock-paper-scissors, and I lost.

341
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,230
I was afraid I'd be a laughingstock if you turned me down,

342
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,050
but since you started walking home with me,they never found out you actually did.

343
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,490
Thanks.

344
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,920
But I figured it was about time I told you.

345
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,640
Sorry for lying to you for the past week.

346
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,830
A novel? Seriously? You're too funny!

347
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,760
Let me read it!

348
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,610
Damn, you wrote a lot! What the hell?

349
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,110
Hey, come on. Don't just read it like that.

350
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,040
It's really embarrassing.

351
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,370
Are you actually writing this seriously, Emi?

352
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,160
Of course not. I was just a little bored.

353
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,110
How bored could you possibly beto write this crap?

354
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,980
Instead of wasting your time writing this drivel, go to the arcade with us!

355
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,960
It's not like I spend all my time on it.

356
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,670
Hey, stop that. You're littering.

357
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,050
No, if you're going to do it, make sure it's all ripped up.

358
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,480
Stop... that.

359
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,060
Who are you?

360
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,440
Kageyama-kun?

361
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,070
Oh, hey! It's that guy!

362
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,320
The one who turned statue during his speech!

363
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,360
Wow, so he can talk.

364
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,710
What the hell's your problem?

365
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,410
Still think you're dating Emi?She only asked you out on a dare, dude.

366
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,400
Hilarious.

367
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,330
She's not your girlfriend!

368
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,080
It's really mean of you to rip upthe novel she worked so hard to write.

369
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,060
Huh?

370
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,790
You said it was just to kill time, right?

371
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,750
Y-Yeah. Something like that.

372
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,050
What the hell's your problem? Get a clue.

373
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,870
Scram.

374
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,050
Didn't you hear me? Get outta here!

375
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,150
I don't think this is trash.

376
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
If you're going to throw it away, I'll take it.

377
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,620
I made the decision toconsider my feelings more.

378
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,410
And you need to pick upthings you feel are important.

379
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,160
Wh-What the hell is he talking about?

380
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,790
Talk about creepy...

381
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,910
Emi?!

382
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,870
You guys can head home.

383
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,330
Oh, really?

384
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,500
Okay, then.

385
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,760
Bye-bye.

386
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,270
Aw...

387
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,230
What are we even doing?

388
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,230
Wanna chase after them?

389
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,150
But... Thank you.

390
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,150
No going back...

391
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,610
Forget this. I can just write it again.

392
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,310
You see...

393
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,520
Adventure

394
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,370
I happen to be an esper.

395
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,730
Thank you, Kageyama-kun.

396
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,920
Smooth.

397
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,460
Ripped Apart~Someone Is Watching~

398
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,020
What? Seriously?

399
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,920
If something that fun was going on,you should've called me!

400
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,570
I never would've expected you to show someone your powers on your own!

401
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,990
So, what happened after that?

402
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,890
What do you mean?

403
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,810
With that Emi girl or whatever.

404
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,350
Did her attitude toward you changewhen she saw your powers?

405
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,610
Did she go, "I've really fallen for you now,"or something like that?

406
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,320
That would never happen just because I have psychic powers.

407
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,780
Really? Is that how it is?

408
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,390
Psychic powers, huh...

409
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,420
Kageyama-kun sure is amazing.

410
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,710
A middle school student... with psychic powers...

411

More importantly, you fell for another love letter?

412
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,390
Looks like you'll always needan advisor like me, Shigeo!

413
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,570
From now on, I'll always stay by your side!

414
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,430
That's gross.

415
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,490
You're not nice to me, but I knew that.
