1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,210
We have a transfer student joining us today.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,730
Go ahead and introduce yourself.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,230
I'm Asagiri Minori.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,980
AsagiriMinori

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,980
Nice to meet you.

6
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,110
Mob Psycho

7
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,000
Discord~Choices~

8
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,890
What? Your dad runs a company, Asagiri-san?

9
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,850
That's awesome!

10
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,760
Wanna come over sometime?

11
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,980
Heck yeah!

12
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,670
Let's have a welcoming party.

13
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,550
All right. Whoever's going, write your name down.

14
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,510
I'm definitely writing my name down!

15
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,910
No need to bother asking Kageyama.

16
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,050
Yeah.

17
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,220
What's his deal? The token punching bag?

18
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,580
Who knows? I've never really thought about him.

19
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,350
He's barely noticeable.

20
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,320
Hope

21
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,770
Oh, I see...

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,110
The people here are accurate representationsof actual people from the real world.

23
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,820
So what you're experiencing is a parallel world that could've easily come to pass

24
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,410
had your circumstances been slightly different.

25
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,880
And I'll observe how you fare in thisenvironment without your powers.

26
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,530
Don't give me that "I don't know" crap!

27
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,550
Are my lessons that boring?

28
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,840
You can stay standing.

29
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,880
All that was left in the problem was addition.

30
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,710
Talk about lame.

31
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,940
He's too stupid.

32
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,030
Hey, stop that...

33
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,470
He's completely frozen.

34
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,280
You had plenty of relationships in real life,

35
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,760
and you were fortunate enough to be surrounded by good people.

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,400
Situations like that are extremely rare.

37
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,190
You don't have a phone or wallet on you,and no parents at home?

38
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,650
Don't give me that shit! How about I give you a nose job?!

39
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,770
Please... let me go...

40
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,410
What? You wanna go?

41
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,610
Bring it!

42
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,980
Get 'im, Sugimoto!

43
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,370
Come on! Come on!

44
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,910
Where the hell are you looking?!

45
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,830
Your extremely talented brother is no more than a stranger here.

46
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,410
It looks like you refrain from usingyour powers in your personal life.

47
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,610
I'm guessing you're trying tobecome a better person

48
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:31,640
by focusing on developing your social skillsrather than your powers,

49
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,570
but only the fortunate in lifewould even have that idea.

50
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,780
It shows how lightly you take the real world.

51
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,610
If only I were stronger...

52
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,280
Nature

53
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,030
Dream

54
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,490
Friendship

55
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,490
Darkness

56
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,490
Nature

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,490
Here, have some milk!

58
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,370
Wait, didn't you mention you loved milk?

59
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,630
Isn't this what you meant?

60
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,500
Ew, you reek of milk.

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,170
One of you better mop that up.

62
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,180
I'm sure that this must seem inexplicable to you,

63
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,120
but she's bullying you in order to secure her position in society,

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,640
and it's something she's done routinely.

65
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,870
If you don't become stronger, you'll be used, exploited,

66
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,250
and forever a stepping stone for others.

67
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,020
Not looking good.

68
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,690
Pretty sure Shigeo lost.

69
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,890
But it hasn't even been thirty minutes yet.

70
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,490
That's way too long!

71
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,740
He should've been done in a minute.

72
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,830
If this keeps up, his sense of self will fall apart.

73
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,700
He's going to die!

74
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,860
Mob is someone who can solve things on his own.

75
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,790
He actually has strength, unlike me.

76
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,570
Quit being naïve. The next time this guy wakes up, we're all finished.

77
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,330
Anxiety, fear, rage...

78
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,590
All the negative emotions arecollectively welling up within you.

79
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,200
That's only natural after living in this world for six months without your powers.

80
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,150
You mustn't misuse your powers.

81
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:04,820
Calpas

82
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:04,820
Saga Building

83
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,650
I could see spirits ever since I was born.

84
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,170
I even had the power to exorcise them.

85
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,570
At first, I used my powers for good,

86
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,510
by giving advice and solving various problems.

87
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,910
The Psychic of the CenturyMogami Keiji-san

88
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,820
But my mother developed a mysterious illness,

89
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,250
and the fees for her treatment were obscene.

90
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:23,800
Eventually, I started taking undergroundjobs to kill people for money.

91
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,720
I even gave up sleepto earn as much as I could.

92
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,100
But my mother still died.

93
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,580
The cause of her illnessremained unclear to the end.

94
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,440
There was nothing anyone could do.

95
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,400
But then, I found out...

96
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,690
After her death, my mother became an evil spirit and said...

97
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,650
It's all your fault!

98
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,960
My own actions brought forth evil around me,

99
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,120
and that's what ended up plaguing her.

100
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,580
I should've doubted my way of life,how I was being used by others.

101
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,540
Suicide by Hanging

102
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,090
Early yesterday, Mogami Keiji-san,the famous psychic, was discovered dead.

103
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,540
News

104
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,010
I became an evil spirit and decided to use my powers for myself this time.

105
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,010
According to the MPD, the cause of death was suicide.

106
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,470
I was going to change the world.

107
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,020
I began to punish those who brought misfortune to others.

108
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,820
If I dwelt within that girl,

109
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,900
I knew that I could punish these self-proclaimed psychics as well.

110
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,150
This is how I chose to use my powers.

111
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,680
You are allowed to use your powers for yourself...

112
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,700
No, you should be using your powers for yourself.

113
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,100
You understand that now, don't you?

114
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,560
Here you go.

115
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,300
Well, that's a crappy thing to do.

116
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,010
Don't you know that feeding straysis a public disservice?

117
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,520
What are you going to do about that cat?

118
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,800
N-Nothing...

119
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,820
Really? That poor thing.

120
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,720
In that case, the cat's probably better off dying.

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
I'll go take it to a shelter.

122
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,800
Don't... I'll take it in. I'll take care of it!

123
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,300
Quit scaring Asagiri-san, you punk!

124
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,130
The door broke open!

125
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,070
But it was sealed so tightly...

126
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,600
It worked out because he's not concentratingas much of his power out here.

127
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,200
Now we can get out.

128
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,910
Call an ambulance!

129
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,830
Carry out the wounded!

130
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,840
You're not going to run away?

131
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,450
Shigeo's done for.

132
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,550
Why are you staying behind?

133
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,380
Because I trust in him.

134
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,090
In this situation? Are you really this stupid?

135
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,850
Yup, I am.

136
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,560
This is probably the first time someone'splaced so much trust in you too, right?

137
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,380
Mob trusts us... because he's stupid.

138
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,240
I've still got plenty of use for him,

139
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,820
and considering that, running away is the last thing I want to do.

140
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,580
Well, I can't bring out Shigeo's latent powers on my own.

141
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,160
In that case, it'd be more effective to manipulate him from the shadows.

142
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,960
I changed my mind. I'll stay behind as well.

143
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,920
Good. Let's wait this out.

144
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,380
Nope. Waiting's not going to bring Shigeo back.

145
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,390
I guess I'll have to take care of this myself.

146
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,930
Are you frustrated? Enraged?

147
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,890
Do you hate them? Do you despise them?

148
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,680
They are a cancer to society.

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,940
Stop letting them use you.

150
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,420
You will be reborn as my sympathizer.

151
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,340
I shall give you strength...

152
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,120
Make your negative emotions explodeand use them against the world!

153
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,120
I'm having a hard time getting in... Shigeo actually got through this shield?

154
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,710
Damn it!

155
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,250
Hey, I can feel my spiritual power spiking.

156
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,600
This should work!

157
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,420
Did it work?

158
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,910
You owe me one.

159
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,860
Now that I've helped you, you'd better win this.

160
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,600
Wh-What's with you?

161
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,270
I-I can have Papa's bodyguards beat the crap out of you anytime I want!

162
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,580
So what?

163
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,390
Apologize.

164
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,080
Yes... Make her disappear!

165
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,750
Apologize.

166
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,210
I-I'm sorry...

167
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,970
If you ever bother me again...

168
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,430
Die, you freak!

169
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,020
You should just die.

170
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,480
What did I ever do to you people?

171
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,840
I can't think of a single thing...

172
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,490
But it doesn't matter.

173
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,240
None of this matters.

174
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,410
It's complete. You finally changed.

175
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,300
You were a lot like me,

176
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,350
and that's why I didn't want you to travel the same path I did.

177
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,880
Hey.

178
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,340
The snot's talking?!

179
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,300
No trespassingSeasoning Realty

180
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,300
Man, you're pretty far gone, aren't you?

181
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,510
Hey, do you know who I am?

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,500
What the heck is this creature?

183
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,730
Actually, before that...

184
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,430
There he is.

185
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,750
Quit lurking.

186
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,770
Damn you for actually falling for these illusions.

187
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,230
Fine.

188
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,690
I'll have to use all the spiritual powerI've stocked up, but...

189
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,030
Time for some shock therapy!

190
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,830
Remember, Shigeo.

191
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,350
Reigen and I are waiting for you outside!

192
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,330
Rei... gen? Who's that?

193
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,800
Oh, hey, Mob. Sorry, but could you hurry to the office?

194
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,760
A huge job just came in.

195
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,030
Your master needs your help, so you better hurry it up.

196
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,470
Mas... ter?

197
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,890
Stop using your powers fordumb things in this dumb world.

198
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,090
Don't you want to be a big brotheryour little brother can look up to?

199
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,780
My little brother? Look up to me?

200
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,650
I accidentally wore the wrong shoes. These are Ritsu's.

201
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,700
Don't let Mogami influence you like that.

202
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,090
You even managed to stick to your valueswhen you fought Hanazawa!

203
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,820
That's right...

204
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,620
I'm not supposed to use these powers against other people.

205
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,080
Not to mention, why are you losing so easily to commoners?

206
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,550
You bring shame to the Body Improvement Club!

207
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,800
Where did all those muscles you built up go?

208
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,530
I don't know how much time you've spent in this dump,

209
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,130
but this isn't like you.

210
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,390
Do you want your belovedTsubomi-chan to hate you?

211
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,980
Well done.

212
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,080
Nii-san.

213
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,940
Heya.

214
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,600
Body improvement!

215
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,900
Fight on!

216
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,780
Okay, that's going way too far...

217
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,320
I remember.

218
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,910
Do you remember me, too?I'm your partner!

219
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,840
No, not really...

220
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,360
Seriously?

221
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,840
I'm kidding.

222
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,880
Thanks, Dimple.

223
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,340
So what if your memories came back?

224
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,310
The six months you've spent here are forever etched into your heart.

225
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,310
I know you were hearing my voice subconsciously.

226
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,730
Mogami...

227
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,850
Just like you said, the world can bea cruel and messed-up place.

228
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,820
You helped me see it in a new light.

229
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,280
Huh? Don't tell me you...

230
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,740
I'm truly blessed. I need to be more thankful to everyone around me

231
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,660
once I get back to the real world.

232
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,960
So that's how it's going to be?

233
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,570
And here I thought I'd founda sympathizer. How disappointing.

234
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,170
One other thing.

235
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,010
People can change through their interactions with others.

236
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,330
I was able to change because of everyone.

237
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,590
I was able to become a little strongerthan if I had been alone.

238
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,680
If I'm able to change, then everyone else should be able to as well.

239
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,010
That means no one is worthless.

240
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,060
Don't say another word...

241
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,530
Or you'll have hell to pay.

242
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,080
The Shigeo you fabricated mightsuccumb to you, but I won't.

243
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm not going to run.

244
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,160
I still have that awful Asagiri-san to save.

245
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,960
Mob Psycho

246
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,460
Mob Psycho

247
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,180
A spiritual mutation?

248
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,390
Guess we're gonna have to fight!You up for this, Shigeo?

249
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,310
Looks like there's nothing to worry about.

250
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,570
Here come more of them!

251
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,290
Every inhabitant of this world is...

252
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,290
Shigeo!

253
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
That's...

254
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,180
I'm going to defeat this evil spirit and go back to reality.

255
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,010
And what good would that do?

256
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,080
The life you lead won't change,and nor will society's absurdities.

257
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,650
There will be plenty of things to annoy and trouble you.

258
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,800
The outside world is... scary?

259
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,780
Life is frustrating, devoid of meaning,and so, so painful.

260
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,160
I can hear them...

261
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,990
The voices of the deadare speaking to me.

262
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,560
So many screams...

263
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,690
They died feeling like this?

264
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,620
Is this how they felt when they were alive?

265
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,050
It's such a cruel world...

266
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,320
Am I really going to be able to...

267
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,220
...me...

268
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,510
That voice!

269
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,180
Help me...

270
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,270
Oh... That's right.

271
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,070
I came here to save someone.

272
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,160
I always thought these powerswere of no use to anybody,

273
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,710
but I'll use them to save people!

274
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,870
It doesn't matter what you do. You cannot defeat me!

275
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,640
Shigeo... you did it.

276
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,940
Well, I'll be damned.

277
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,320
You're not the same boy from earlier.

278
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,770
Who are you?

279
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,020
You finally get how freaky he is?

280
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,070
This is Kageyama Shigeo's true form that he reveals when he's pissed—

281
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,870
Dimple.

282
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,040
It's dangerous, so leave this to me and stay back.

283
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,000
Actually, yeah, who are you?

284
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,010
Mogami had overlooked somethingthat lay dormant within Mob.

285
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,370
A person's heart is made up of two sides of the same coin.

286
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,390
Just as happiness shinesin the shadows of sorrow,

287
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,470
only in the darkest depths of fear

288
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,940
does courage truly shine.

289
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:14,520
The powerful blast from Mob's positive emotions at 100%

290
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,020
annihilated the great evil spirit, Mogami.

291
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,810
Or at least, that's how it looked.

292
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,960
Now that they've lost me, their vessel,

293
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,070
all of the evil spirits that I'd taken inand controlled will all be freed at once.

294
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,970
Not even I can stop them anymore.

295
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,910
Shigeo!

296
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,740
Dimple, go ahead and head back!

297
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,620
I'll be fine!

298
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,750
Y-You sure about that?!

299
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,980
I'm going to save Asagiri-san.

300
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,520
I'm going to completely exorcise them before I leave.

301
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,480
I'll be back, I promise.

302
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,190
Don't worry.

303
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,720
You trying to eat me, too?

304
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,340
Damn it. Catch me if you can, you bastards!

305
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,400
Bring it!

306
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,870
I'll be waiting for you on the other side!

307
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,310
In this world,

308
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,320
everything I can see is a spirit.

309
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,550
I have to exorcise them all.

310
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,330
No matter how much you struggle,

311
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,890
your path will lead you to the same place mine did...

312
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,550
To ruin.

313
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,420
I'm going to save her... I...

314
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,270
I can't go out like this!

315
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,810
I see.

316
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,330
Your vessel has been shattered,

317
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,750
and that's what is inside?

318
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,610
I actually thought you might've died.

319
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,170
That took you ages.

320
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,980
Yes, a very long time...

321
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,290
Master, how's Asagiri-san?

322
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,410
Well, if you're awake...

323
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,880
He's still—

324
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,320
You've made your choice.

325
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,480
I'll keep watching from afar to seeif you made the right one.

326
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,950
You're not going anywhere, my pet.

327
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,450
That was an unexpected trophy. Thank you.

328
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,990
Isn't that... I didn't evenrealize he was here.

329
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,480
I'll make sure I take really good care of him.

330
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,690
Farewell. Perhaps we'll see each other again.

331
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,550
Kageyama-kun?

332
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,910
Yeah.

333
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,240
What? You guys know each other?

334
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,540
Nah, she probably just remembers what happened over there.

335
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,260
Are you really always like that?

336
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,700
Yeah... I am.

337
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,790
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,900
I'm really... really sorry...

339
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,840
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

340
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,550
It's okay. I understand.

341
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,760
Understand what?

342
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,550
That people can change.

343
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,120
Mogami-san and Asagiri-san taught me that.

344
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,220
The people around me changed me as well.

345
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,760
Now I know that I might be able to change others too,

346
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,950
so I'm glad we were able to meet.

347
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,770
Thank you...

348
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,280
So you're saying the one who saved you is a boy in your grade?

349
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,370
Yeah, why?

350
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,640
There wasn't a middle school studentamong the people I hired.

351
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,330
Huh?

352
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,760
He wasn't even asked to be there,

353
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,200
but he managed to exorcise an evil spirit that no one else could

354
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,050
and left without saying a word.

355
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,070
That's so cool.

356
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,470
I hope I can see him again.

357
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,560
I did a bit of research, and this caught my eye.

358
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,060
Psycho Helmet Religion

359
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,060
Huh? Isn't that...

360
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,830
Our religious organization is notgoing to survive on donations alone.

361
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,410
It's going to be impossibleto build a headquarters.

362
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,200
Not to mention our beloved founder is still nowhere to be found.

363
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,000
Ow.

364
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Current Balance:

365
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Thank you for your continued business with us.\h\hThere has been a deposit of 500,000,000 JPY to your account.\h\h\hThank you\h\h\h\hCurrent available balance: 500,010,180 JPY

366
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,360
Master, why aren't you going to claim your reward?

367
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,440
Look how many people got hurt.

368
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,450
I wouldn't exactly call that a success.

369
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,750
You should never accept moneyyou feel you haven't earned.

370
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,730
If you do, you'll start toalways take the easy way out.

371
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,830
You just don't want to be held responsible.

372
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,260
That's not it, you moron!

373
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,720
Anyway, no good ever comes outof drowning in wealth or power.

374
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,600
Mogami let his own powersswallow him up, too.

375
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,560
You know...

376
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:49,030
You're better off working part-time for methan becoming famous or powerful.

377
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,950
Oh, give me a friggin' break...

378
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,980
Hey, quit clowning around with your classmates, Mob! We're busy here.

379
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,060
They're just using you!

380
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,210
Jeez. You never learn, do you?

381
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,750
Next time on Mob Psycho 100 II Episode 6:

382
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,840
"Poor, Lonely, Whitey."

383
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,210
Poor, Lonely, Whitey

384
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,660
The DVDs? That's an excellent decision!
