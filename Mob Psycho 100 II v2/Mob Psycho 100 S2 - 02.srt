00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,200
This is so boring, Mob.

Ura Sunday

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,730
Doesn't that just meanno one's being bothered by spirits?

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,980
I hate this.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,280
It's really peaceful.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,780
But we need food on our table!

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,940
We have to make a move.

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,990
You don't know what true fear is

Urban Legends~Encountering Rumors~

13
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,710
Urban legends?

14
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,580
Yeah. Surely you've discussed somewith friends at some point.

15
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,080
I haven't, actually.

16
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,930
Really? They were super popularwhen I was a kid.

17
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,400
Like Hanako-san in the bathroom or the human-faced dog...

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,210
Or, if you want something newer, the Dragger.

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,830
We'll look up sighting reports onlineand follow these urban legends.

20
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,800
So it's like when we went to find the tsuchinoko?

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,570
Not quite.

22
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,030
The Dragger is completely made up.She doesn't exist.

23
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,000
Then, why...

24
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,520
Places where urban legends are popular

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,710
tend to have a lot of peoplewho easily believe in the supernatural.

26
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,920
Meaning they're gold minesfor exorcism jobs.

27
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,550
You're so excited aboutthis Schadenfreude search.

28
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,470
The key to successfulwalk-in sales is a smile!

Spiritual Advice

31
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,170
That table is really low.

32
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,390
I didn't think this through.

33
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,670
Those are some cold stares...

34
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,550
Uh, we might be bothering the pedestrians.

35
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,800
Hey, you two.

36
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,570
Who said you couldconduct your business here?

37
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,560
You dare set up shop here knowing that I,

Rising Sun Spiritual UnionShinra Banshomaru

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,850
Shinra Banshomaru, the greatest psychic of this century, hold jurisdiction here?

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,740
He's the "greatest of this century," too?

41
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,260
What do you mean, jurisdiction?

42
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,490
You're not a member ofthe Rising Sun Spiritual Union?

43
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,230
I'm a freelancer. The name's Reigen Arataka.

44
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,820
If you're also running a spirit con—business,

45
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,850
could you introduce me to some clients?

46
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,470
I haven't had too many lately.

47
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm not about to help a business rival.

48
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,470
Begone at once!

49
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,850
I respectfully decline.

50
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,610
What authority do you have?

51
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,480
Free psychic readings

52
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,480
This is clearly a traffic violation.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,330
You guys have no right to bring up the law.

54
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,790
And what do you mean by that?

55
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,950
Um...

56
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,850
Are you psychics?

57
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,020
Yes?

58
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,370
I'd like to discuss something with you.

59
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,790
Happy to help you out, ma'am!

60
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,790
But of course!

61
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,830
So what did you want to discuss?

62
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,970
I've always been susceptible to spirits.

63
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,300
I often attract ghosts and other strange phenomena near me.

64
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,590
Even as we speak, there's something next to me...

65
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,200
Next to you? I don't—

66
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
There definitely is. I see it.

67
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,610
Hey, stop making things up.

68
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,920
What did you say, you swine?

69
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,340
Give me a break. Fakes like you make my job so much harder.

70
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,310
Right, Mob?

71
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,920
It's the spirit of a middle-aged man.

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,270
Let's get back on track.

73
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,450
Thank goodness. You're actual psychics.

74
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,240
When I asked about it on the internet,all I got was irresponsible advice.

75
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,700
What are you writing?

76
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,870
I can't believe I never thoughtabout a website.

77
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,210
I'll make one as soon as I'm home.

78
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,290
And lately, I've been feeling a really bad aura.

79
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,800
I've only been able to get by thanks tohaving a plate of salt in my apartment.

80
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,270
I see. Textbooks confirmthe effectiveness of piles of salt.

81
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,560
Indeed. Even as we speak,the sodium from this pile of French fries

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,970
is mitigating the negative effects.

83
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,820
Mob, don't eat too many of those.

84
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,780
But then I realized that the reasonthis eerie feeling has gotten worse lately

85
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,390
is because of the sudden spread of urban legends around this city.

86
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,780
Cuticle City Urban Legends

87
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,780
Human-Faced Dog

88
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,780
It's said that the vengeful spirit of a middle-agedman who committed suicide possessed a dog.It rummages through the trash downtown,and if you call it, it'll say, "Just leave me alone."

89
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,780
Dash Granny

90
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,780
When you're driving on the freeway in themiddle of the night, you might hear a tappingon your window. You'll then see a grannyrunning alongside your car at the same speed.Apparently, if she outruns you, you'll get into a car accident.

91
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,780
The Red Raincoat

92
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,780
It wanders endlessly through the city in the rain,dressed in all red. If someone sees the red raincoat,they will die. However, if you're wearing somethingred, your life will be spared.

93
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,780
The Dragger

94
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,780
Dressed in torn white clothing, the Dragger dragspeople around until they are but lumps of meat.When she was human, she suffered from horrible bullying,and from that hatred, she'll capture children and drag them around.

95
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,870
Human-Faced Dog, Dash Granny,the Red Raincoat,

96
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,380
and of course... the Dragger.

97
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,410
Please, eliminate all of these urban legends.

98
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,120
Come on... Who would takesuch an impossible request?

99
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,610
Please leave it to me, Reigen Arataka!

100
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,110
I'll make sure they're wiped offthe face of this earth!

101
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,940
So, which course would you like to go with?

102
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,760
"Course"?

103
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,590
I recommend this weekend combo deal...

104
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,680
I must say, I was surprisedyou accepted a request like that.

105
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,390
And 20,000 yen if the request works out?

106
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,660
You'd ask for about that much, wouldn't you?

107
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,550
I generally start at 200,000.

108
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,640
If I actually took on this request, it'd be more than 500,000—

109
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,360
Well, you'll still be helping me with this.

110
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,070
I'm sorry? What did he just say?

111
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,640
Let's get going. If we keep wasting time,the sun's gonna go down.

112
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,790
Um... Shinrin Maruo, was it?

113
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,070
It's Shinra Banshomaru, and I'm not going to help you!

114
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,500
Shinra Banshomaru

115
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,500
You heard her out with me,so don't you dare run away.

116
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,180
That makes no sense.

117
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,900
I'll make sure you get your cut.

118
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,590
Let's split up and do some investigating.

119
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,550
New Star of the Psychic World

120
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,550
Let's remember the three Cs:contact, communicate, and consult.

121
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,880
Oh, fine.

122
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,800
I'll consider this charity workand help you out.

123
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,780
Yeah, I'm counting on you.

124
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,830
Like you have anything better to do.

125
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,770
Mob, is Dimple around?

126
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,050
Dimple, you're being summoned.

127
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,230
What do you want?

128
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,210
I'm making myself less visiblebecause I'm sick of talking to you.

129
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,070
Come on, don't be like that. We're work buddies.

130
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,640
How?!

131
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,300
You just order me around—

132
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,450
Tail that chubster usingthat stealth mode of yours.

133
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,280
Why should I?

134
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,910
If he runs off, just let him go.

135
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,380
Nah, I bet he's a super serious moronthat does everything by the book.

136
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,690
Meaning, if something were to happen to him,

137
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,340
it'd be my fault for making him do this.

138
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,550
Please, Dimple. It'd be better to avoid any accidents.

139
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,180
Watch out for suspicious people

140
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,650
Oh, fine.

141
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,180
This is give and take.

142
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,660
You're going to have to listen to one of my demands sometime soon, Shigeo!

143
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,520
What's the matter, Mob?

144
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,970
Well, it's like the client said. Something's weird about this town.

145
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,520
There might actually be something here.

146
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,290
Why did we come to an internet café?

147
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,160
If I go around questioning kids,people might think I'm someone suspicious.

148
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,120
Cuticle Middle School Dark Messageboard

149
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,120
Make sure you keep posting! (^o^)/

150
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,120
2950. Another crappy day~

152

My teacher is so frickin' annoying.Who do they think they are, bossing me around every day?Totally ignoring them.

153
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,930
Wow. It's all just a bunch of complaints.

154
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,960
Someone was sucking up to the math teacher today.It was so gross.Do people seriously enjoy doing that?

155
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,960
2953. Hey, did you see?

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,630
There must be something usefulwithin this barrage of complaints...

160
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,630
\h\h\h\h2955. Re: Re: Hey, did you see?Name: Student E  Date: 9/28 (Fri) 16:26I wanna go, too lolol

161
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,630
2956. This is scary

163
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,630
Did you hear that the dash granny showed up in OO Tunnel?

164
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,630
2957. Re: This is scaryI've heard of her, but I don't know anyone who's seen her

165
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,760
Hey, look!

166
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,970
Cuticle Park

167
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,520
Sighting report!

168
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,090
We saw an old guy in red earlier.

169
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,180
He tried to talk to us, so we ran away.

170
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,970
What? When?!

171
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,320
Wh-Where? Where was he?!

172
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,390
Hey, that hurts! Let go!

173
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,520
Why's this guy breathing so heavily?

174
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,480
O-Oh, I'm sorry. I just got a bit excited...

175
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,190
Uh, wait, I didn't mean excited in that kind of way...

176
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,030
Why are you looking at me like that?

177
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,410
We're leaving now.

178
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,240
Hey!

179
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,030
You mustn't go alone! You're girls!

180
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,400
Get away from us!

181
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,750
This guy's a pervert!

182
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,480
Hey, stop that!

183
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,540
I'm not—

184
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,540
Huh? What?

185
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,290
Stare

186
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,540
Stare

187
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,770
N-No! I'm not a pervert!

188
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,890
I'm an extremely well-known psychic!

189
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,920
Did he just say psychic?

190
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,760
Like that doesn't sound shady...

191
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,260
Ow!

192
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,330
Hey, don't throw rocks at me!

193
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,850
Ow!

194
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,560
That guy was so gross.

195
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,190
Wait! I need that lead!

196
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,840
Crap! The girls I was after!

197
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,390
Wait, was that...

198
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,690
Hold it right there!

199
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,280
You must be the Red Raincoat!

200
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,450
Don't get in my way!

201
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,850
There's nothing fun about exposing myself to another guy!

202
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,850
So you're a flasher who goes after children?

203
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,370
You filthy criminal!

204
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,040
This is awesome! Creep versus creep!

205
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
Get a video of this!

206
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,370
I may not look it, but I was vice captainof the sumo club in grade school!

207
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,250
I give up!

208
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,660
I give up, so let me go!

209
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,470
You got me...

210
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,670
Or so you thought...

211
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,960
I was on the track team in middle school, fatty!

212
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,460
Talk about playing dirty.

213
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,900
But damn, he's fast.

214
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,150
Terror

215
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,820
This is the human-faced dog?

216
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,310
That looks like marker. I guess the sighting report was fake.

217
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,230
No, this is definitely the human-faced dog.

218
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,530
What do you mean?

219
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,930
This is usually how rumors go.

220
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,500
To grade and middle school kids,this is the real deal.

221
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,890
Hey, someone's at our human-faced dog's house.

222
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,340
We should charge admission.

223
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,850
Whose dog is this?

224
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,760
The old guy who lives here.

225
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,740
His eyes are bad, so he hasn't noticedwe scribbled on its face.

226
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,200
A-Are you his grandkids?

227
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,680
Huh? Why?

228
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,620
Hey, you little shits!

229
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,650
I'll kick your asses the next time you try to draw on this dog's face!

230
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,510
So he says after he actually hit us.

231
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,110
We're gonna tell the PTA on you.

232
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,150
Yeah, just try it.

233
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,530
You know what this world needs?Adults who can keep you little shits in line!

234
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,950
Don't think that I, Suzuki Taro, am going to be a pushover like your teachers.

235
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,920
But you use a fake name anyway?

236
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,130
You'll give Terror a bath?

237
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,670
What a nice young man.

238
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,090
Was he that dirty? Then, I guess I'll take you up on your offer.

239
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,710
Here, Terror.

240
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,730
Look at him happily wag his tailwith his ominous-sounding name.

241
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,510
Now, then...

242
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,930
We'll need before and after picturesfor our progress report.

243
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,570
I wonder if he just likes dogs.

244
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,230
Did you know it was just a prank to begin with?

245
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,630
Of course I did.

246
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,760
Were you actually looking for a dog with a person's face?

247
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,350
There, there.

248
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,160
Dog Shampoo

249
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,160
Dirt-be-gone

250
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,160
Boney Bones

251
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,160
Nom

252
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,650
Let's see if we can get some hot water for him.

253
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,120
What? You outta breath?

254
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,790
Too bad for you. I may have been in the sumo club in grade school,

255
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,090
but in middle school,I was on the table tennis team!

256
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm plenty confident about my stamina!

257
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,350
You're so out of breath, though.

258
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,310
Why are you chasing me?This has nothing to do with you.

259
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,830
Ever heard of citizen's arrest?

260
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,920
Even a civilian can arresta criminal in the act.

261
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,120
Let the blades of justice strike you down, you pervert!

262
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,030
You seriously thought you caught me?

263
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,610
I led you here on purpose!

264
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,310
I will admit, this all started as an unusual fetish.

265
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,330
But before long, I started finding pleasurein rumors of me spreading around town.

266
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,140
I felt like some kind of celebrity!

267
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,760
Just by wearing this raincoat,I feel unstoppable!

268
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,720
You wanna turn me in to the police?

269
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
I'd love to see you try!

270
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,360
He passed out.

271
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,170
But he and others saw my face, which willmake things harder for me in this town.

272
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,810
Guess it's time to leave.

273
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,450
No Trespassing

274
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,590
Who the hell are you? Did you see everything?

275
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,050
Hey, aren't you thirsty?

276
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,260
What, it's just some crazy bitch?

277
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,900
Hey, aren't you thirsty?

278
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,360
Yeah...

279
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,190
Never been thirstier!

280
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,110
I'll let you drink until you explode, then!

281
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,090
Spirit Hold

282
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,090
Spirit Hold! There, now you can't move!

283
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,770
Damn it! I've not recovered from being tased!

284
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,480
Wha—

285
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,690
Where'd she go?!

286
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,960

Mob Psycho100

290
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,230
Guess Reigen was rightto send me as insurance!

291
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,160
Talk about pressure...Her aura's stabbing me left and right.

292
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,120
Guess I'll try to drag out all of this guy's latent powers.

293
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,080
Hey, aren't you thirsty?!

294
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,790
You tryin' to hit on me?

295
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,050
I'm not a fan of forceful girls!

296
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,510
Take that!

297
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

298
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,820
To think his manual would save him this way...

299

Spiritual Worldismfor Psychics

300
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,580
His life comes first...

301
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,780
I'll happily turn tail and run away!

302
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,560
I need to send an SOS!

303
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,960
There, all clean.

304
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,670
Mob, how did you get that wet?

305
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,550
I shouldn't have helped.

306
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,130
Hello, this is Reigen.

307
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,100
Hey, did you get any info...

308
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,060
Let's go.

309
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,030
The Dragger showed up.

310
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,280
No wonder she's trending in the urban legends world.

311
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,850
Maybe because she's all over social media,she's got way more energy fueling her.

312
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,040
And now she's going for function over form.

313
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,490
His Achilles tendon just snapped!

314
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,250
You damn fatty... You need to exercise more.

315
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,710
Please, Dimple.

316
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,590
If I let this guy die, Shigeo will lose faith in me.

317
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,820
And I can't let that happen!

318
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,830
He's going to be even bigger someday.

319
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,980
I can't mess up at a place like this.

320
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,460
Oh, shit.

321
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,690
Thanks, Dimple.

322
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,810
Wow, so that's the Dragger?

323
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,920
Is that actually her?

324
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,870
I need to get a photo for proof.

325
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,630
Huh?

326
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,250
She's not showing up on my screen.

327
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,630
She ran!

328
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,890
That's a monster born from rumors.

329
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,160
You can't classify her as real or fake.

330
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,970
What do you mean?

331
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,790
The imagination of the masses,

332
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,270
and their fear and curiosity,is what gave birth to her.

333
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,980
Her looks and her strengthwas all decided by humans!

334
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,000
So you're saying their imaginationbecame reality?

335
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,180
Th-That's right...

336
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,200
And since we know about the Dragger,we won't be able to exorcise her.

337
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,680
Huh? Why?

338
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,650
Wasn't there a time as a kid when you were frightened by rumors about her?

339
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,460
True...

340
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,000
The Dragger would appear before kidsheading home from school,

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,460
snatching them up anddragging them into the bog...

342
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,870
I didn't believe in Santa Claus,

343
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,790
but thinking about her on rainy daysas I passed street corners

344
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,390
would give me goosebumps, too.

345
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,280
That fear is still burned into our brains.

346
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,810
We're even trembling as we speak.

347
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,150
So I'm breaking out in a cold sweatbecause I'm scared deep down?

348
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,350
Powers used in fear only empower its source.

349
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,860
My spiritual powers did nothing.

350
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,570
She grows by absorbing the powersof those who fear her.

351
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,460
Attacking her is futile.

352
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,950
Then we have no choice but to run.

353
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,790
Mob, temporary retreat...

354
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,540
Wh-What is this?!

355
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,580
I'm stuck!

356
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,150
This must be her doing.

357
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,160
She's huge!

358
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,160
What?!

359
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,640
Didn't you hear him, Mob?Your powers will be absorbed, too!

360
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,530
Wait, hang on a sec...

361
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,000
It's actually working!

362
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,410
I see... Shigeo...

363
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:04,370
He's detached from urban legends, fads,and other hot topics among people.

364
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,600
He's completely out of the loop!

365
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,880
So he has no ideawhat makes the Dragger so scary!

366
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,060
It's a ghost that appears on rainy days, right?

367
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,770
It's not exactly not scary.

368
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,370
You don't get it!

369
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,160
The Dragger has a grip strengthof 500 kilograms!

370
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,730
Once she grabs you, you can't escape!

371
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,110
And she can swim 100 meters in 20 seconds!

372
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,690
Oh, so that's the kind of character she is.

373
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,190
You'd basically written a fanficabout her in your head, didn't you?

374
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,430
You should at least pretend to bescared or shocked by these things.

375
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,780
This is why nobody clues you in.

376
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,520
But you used to say thatI didn't have to be like others.

377
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,060
Lip service gains importance as you grow up.

378
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,630
I got injured while I was unconscious?

379
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,100
Anyway, thanks. That was a valuable experience.

380
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,440
I'm going to the police now to talk to them about the flasher.

381
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,980
Guess this is goodbye.

382
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,420
Ow!

383
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,890
Yeah, take care.

384
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,110
Well, I guess we should check out Dash Granny before we leave.

385
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,530
Looks like we got here at the perfect time.

386
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,800
Keep your guard up.

387
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,640
There she is! She actually showed up!

388
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,930
Mob! Exorcise her!

389
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,190
Huh? One more time...

390
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,750
Huh?

391
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,980
What's wrong, Shigeo?

392
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,240
She's coming! Hey!

393
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,600
Oh, no... I can't exorcise her...

394
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,240
The Dragger doesn't even compare... She's too powerful.

395
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,620
What?!

396
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,080
Hey, come on now...

397
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,290
What do we do?

398
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,370
There's only one thing we can do! Get away!

399
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,200
Run!

400
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,790
Hey, what happens if she catches up?

401
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,290
Apparently, she jumps on your backand strangles you to death!

402
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,130
Run! Run! She's catching up!

403
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,850
Step on it, Mob!

404
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,530
Turns out she was just some old lady running...

405
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,140
Couldn't you have used your powers to teleport or something?

406
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,250
Why are you crying?

407
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,700
Scrapedhis face

408
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,700
Because... I run every day...

409
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,920
But that old lady beat me!

410
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,170
Ding...

411
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,800
It's not a competition, man.

412
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,170
Well, I got that old lady's picture,

413
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,680
so I guess our work here's done.

414
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:11,100
Dash Granny would become Mob's firsttraumatic experience with urban legends.

415
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,150
Some days later

416
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,150
Spirits and Such Consultation Office

417
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,140
It's finally done!

418
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,420
Take a look, Mob.

419
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,770
Now we'll get even more jobs!

420
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,020
What is this?

421
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,990
Spirits and Such Consultation Office

422
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,990
The star psychic of the 21st centurywho defeated the Dragger

423
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,990
Welcome toReigen Arataka'shomepage!

424
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,990
You're the number

425
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,990
visitor to this page.

426
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,990
It's shady as hell!

427
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,330
Yes! I'm getting one job after another because of my webpage!

428
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,540
But wait, Mob's been acting a bit weird.

429
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,790
What's wrong, Mob?

430
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,440
Next time on Mob Psycho 100 II Episode 3:

431
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,210
"One Danger After Another~Degeneration~."

432
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,050
Recording it? That's also a wise decision.

433
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,210
One Danger After Another~Degeneration~
