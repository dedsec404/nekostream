1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,750
Dang... I finally climbed up the ladder enough to get a TV appearance.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,630
These greenrooms sure domake you restless, though.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,570
Reigen-san, you're up.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,240
All right. Let's do this.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,990
Tea

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,990
Supernatural Detective!Do Spiritual Powers Actually Exist!?Special

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
______________________________________________________________

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A boy was possessed by a fox after playing Kokkuri-san after school!?

10
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,680
Oh, this must be it. Jodo-sama's return to TV.

11
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,130
R-Reigen?!

12
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,080
What the heck is he doing?

13
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,500
And now... Will we be able to save the poor,

14
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,480
Host

15
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,480
Ebihara Morizo

16
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,480
unfortunate young man that's been possessed?

17
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,200
Let's introduce our two powerful helpers!

18
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,440
The first one needs no introduction.

19
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,150
The president of the Rising Sun Spiritual Union, Jodo Kirin-sensei!

20
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,280
Jodo Kirin

21
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,280
He's solved devastating problems for many.He's the best of the best!

22
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,970
The other is making his first appearance on TV.

23
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,640
Reigen Arataka-sensei!

24
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,020
Why, hello there. I'm Reigen Arataka.

25
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,130
You can find my business in Seasoning City.

26
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,590
Do Spiritual Powers Actually Exist!?

27
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,590
Special!

28
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,590
What are some of your accomplishments up till now, Reigen-sensei?

29
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,010
It's hard to choose just one...

30
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,710
Oh, but I did defeat the Dragger.

31
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,270
Mogi Tatsuya

32
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,270
Huh? That's awesome.

33
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,480
Looks like we can expect great things.

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,010
And now, let's bring out the boy.

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,940
Spooky

36
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,490
To be extra careful, since he may freak out,

37
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,680
we have him securely bound.

38
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,330
Go to Reigen-sensei!

39
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,370
Go to Reigen-sensei!

40
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,550
What do you think?

41
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,920
I see...

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,220
The footage we just watched

43
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,210
mentioned that he was possessed by a foxafter playing the Kokkuri-san game.

44
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,340
But to be more precise,

45
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,430
it's a ghost of a Rüppell's fox,which are usually found in North Africa.

46
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,140
What's this? He was able to precisely deduce the kind of ghost it is!

47
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,760
What do you think, Jodo-sensei?

48
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,350
The poor child... being strapped down like that.

49
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,910
I'm hoping we don't have to keep those things on him much longer.

50
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,820
I see. So we all feel the same.

51
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,460
And now, we're finally going to witness the public exorcism!

52
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,780
But before that, a word from our sponsors.

53
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,040
When we're back on air, we're going to have Jodo-sensei do the exorcism.

54
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,430
Actually, why don't we have Reigen-kun give it a shot?

55
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,080
Wha—

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,750
No one wants to see an old man.

57
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,970
Let's show the country howa next-generation psychic does things.

58
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,060
Wasn't I just supposed to sit there and comment today?

59
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,130
I'm trying to give you the spotlight here.

60
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,370
But if you're not up to the task, very well.

61
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,020
I'll do it, just as it says in the script.

62
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,400
The script?

63
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,170
I see!

64
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,270
One moment! I'll do it after all.

65
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,810
Okay... sure.

66
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,360
Reigen-sensei's going to perform the exorcism this time.

67
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,930
We're coming back from commercial!

68
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,750
Supernatural DetectiveSpecial!!

69
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,040
And it looks like we're just about ready for this public exorcism.

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,660
The one performing this exorcism

71
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,870
is an exciting newcomerwho has had a meteoric rise!

72
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,300
Reigen Arataka-sensei! Are you ready?

73
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,300
Karaoke

74
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,090
Leave it to me! I, Reigen Arataka, shall accept this job!

75
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,180
I shall successfully get rid of this spirit!

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,350
Live or not, this is still a TV show.

77
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,580
It's all a setup written by some scriptwriter.

78
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,790
If I do some random exorcism,

79
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,730
that'll quietly be the cue for the boy to calm down

80
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,610
and the studio audience to clap.

81
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,340
Then the host will praise me, and the show will be over.

82
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,710
Splashity Splash

83
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,710
Salt Splash!

84
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,180
And he just started throwing a ton of salt outta nowhere!

85
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,640
The spirit possessing the boy seems to be struggling in agony.

86
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,100
It's working! It's really working!

87
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,140
But it has never worked before!

88
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,810
This kid is acting!

89
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,280
Now that I know that, I'm not pulling any punches!

90
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,200
Sorcery Crush Special!

91
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,650
Air Banishing Salt...

92
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,620
Punch!

93
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,080
A clean hit!

94
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,840
Well, it's been about 30 minutes since the exorcism started,

95
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,880
but apparently, the spirit just refuses to leave.

96
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,120
Talk about resilient.

97
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,120
Evil Spirit Detox Acupressure!

98
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,340
Holy Water Chop!

99
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,240
For real!

100
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,600
I've already used up all my special moves

101
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,760
Sorcery Crush

102
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,760
Aroma Runway Express

103
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,760
Salt Splash

104
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,760
Graphic Exorcism

105
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,760
Hypnosis Punch

106
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,760
and now I'm trying to keep things going with ad-libs!

107
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Banishing Salt Punch

108
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,760
Cheeseburger Tornado

109
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:11,760
Anti-Possession Jumping Knee Strike

110
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,520
All right, let's have our other psychic step in.

111
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,260
Huh?

112
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,140
Jodo Kirin-sensei, if you would.

113
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,440
W-Wait... Was I just an opening act?

114
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,650
Is he going to take all the glory?!

115
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,360
Hang on a sec. I've almost got it.

116
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,410
Switching right now would be—

117
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,200
Look, we're live.

118
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,910
Reigen-kun, good work the last 30 minutes.

119
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,420
You wily, scheming old man!

120
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,750
All right, Jodo-sensei! Let's see you work!

121
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,750
My spotlight!

122
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,900
What am I supposed to exorcise here?This boy isn't even possessed.

123
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,970
He's just acting.

124
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,990
Huh?

125
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,990
Saywha?

126
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,890
Oh, come on, you geezer! Get a clue!

127
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,860
Why'd you ruin all that setup the program built up for you?!

128
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,990
You are absolutely correct!

129
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,610
I'm impressed you were able to see the truth

130
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,070
when everyone in the studio has been tricked this whole time!

131
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:14,370
A true psychic has just been revealed!

132
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,880
My name is Fukuda Suzuo, and I'm a child actor from the Mongolian Spot Agency!

133
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,280
That was some brilliant acting!

134
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,670
Thank you very much!

135
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,700
I could barely tell he was acting!

136
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,680
Sci-fi researcher, Mogi-san, what did you think?

137
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,340
I'd like to ask that gentleman over there

138
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,640
what all that "exorcism" crap was about.

139
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,600
What were you doing to a spirit that didn't even exist?

140
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,810
Reigen-sensei, I'm sure our viewers are wondering that as well.

141
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,570
Could it be... that you actually don't have spiritual powers?

142
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,460
Come, now. Let's just say this is how he works.

143
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,850
Excellent work, Jodo-sensei!

144
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,050
It should've been completely obvious if the boy was possessed or not...

145
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,170
If you're a true psychic, that is.

146
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, I beg your pardon.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,340
It's not like I'm referring to Reigen-san.

148
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,170
I'm sure he was trying to liven things up for the sake of the program.

149
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,000
But I can guarantee that we didn't ask him to do that.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,040
What? Really? Poor Fukuda-kun.

151
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,810
It was basically torture.

152
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,020
Then what in the world were you doing for 30 minutes?

153
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,650
Some new kind of dance?

154
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,000
I mean... It appeared as though that boy was possessed by some spirit...

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,750
So I exorcised it.

156
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,030
Even if he was merely acting like he was possessed,

157
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,070
spirits could come by at any moment.

158
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,100
What? A spirit was here? I didn't even notice.

159
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,660
When did it appear?

160
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,870
About 30 minutes ago...

161
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,920
Right on the dot! I never knew evil spirits were so punctual!

162
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,840
What kind of spirit was it? Huh? What kind of spirit was it?

163
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,550
It was a man...

164
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,510
I think he was German...

165
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,540
Stop it, me! If you say another word...

166
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,900
It was Beethoven.

167
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,770
Du-du-du-dunnn!

Did you watch yesterday's ep of Supernatural Detective?

170
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,410
I did! I laughed so hard!

Naritasan

200
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,420
There's no way that guy's a fraud.

201
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,060
I wonder if Reigen-san has a plan to get out of this.

202
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,750
They're apparently making a group for his victims.

203
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,040
Wanna go?

204
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,380
But we're not victims, though.

205
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,710
So he was a con artist after all.

206
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,260
It's probably his faultwe aren't getting any job offers.

207
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,220
I knew there was something off about him.

208
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,260
I'm gonna feed the mediaeven more bullcrap about him!

00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,020
And he calls himself a spirit medium?

They wanted to undress for an exorcism.

God damn it! I was set up!

But the title and reputation of"scam artist psychic"

spread like wildfire across media platformslike a game of telephone.

And in three days, being the ultimate evilhad basically become Reigen's public image.

What was that so-called exorcism you performed on that show?

279
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320
Don't you think you need to explain yourself?

280
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,970
You could at least give us some answers!

281
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,660
Are you off today?

282

Reigen Arataka, the man who's garnered attention

291
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,680
for allegedly conning people with psychic scams,

292
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,210
announced that he will be holding a press conference tomorrow.

293
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,890
We believe the subjects that will be discussed will include

if his previous activities were indeed illegal,

298
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,120
and if he actually even possesses spiritual powers.

299
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,850

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,720
You seem to be in a lot of trouble. I prepared an apology for you to say at the press conference, so if you get in trouble, just read that. Learn your lesson from this, quit this scamming business, and get a real job. I know your dad doesn't say it much, but he's worried about you. You should come home. You haven't been home lately at all. This is the perfect opportunity for us to all have a family meeting.I'm on your side.

Thank you all for gathering here today.I'm sorry that you all had to take the timeto show up today over my own personal actions.First of all, I'd like to apologize to all the people I've troubled,as well as to all of their friends and family members I may have burdened.I'd like to take this opportunity to formally apologize to everyone.I'm so terribly sorry for everything I've done.(Now, bow.

Shit.

313
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,140
I thought I'd have a chance if we were just going to argue,

314
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,600
but now my head's completely blank.

315
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,670
Calm down.

316
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,810
First, you need to get the reporters to have a good impression of you.

317

F-First, I'd like to thank you all for gathering...

318
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,070
Why did you all gather here today, anyway?

319
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,080
It's pretty common to suddenly get tired of all this shit at the last minute.

320
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,280
What's with that attitude?!

What?!

322
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,420
Are you mocking us?!

323
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,580
You're the one who said you'd hold a press conference!

324
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,630
That's because you guys kept stalking me to my house.

325
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,210
You basically made me hold this thing.

326
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,340
I have a few questions regardingthe fraudulent acts you've committed.

327
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,870
Hang on a sec.

328
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,300
By "fraudulent acts," are you referring to my business?

329
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,460
Is there anyone here that can actually prove I don't have any spiritual powers?

330
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,770
Or maybe any victims who can prove they've been scammed?

331
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,480
There are a lot of people who've reported that they've been scammed—

332
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,320
Right. Self-proclaimed "victims."

333
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,530
Why are you saying it like that?!

334
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,230
Because it hasn't been proven.

335
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,980
Unless and until they are,I can still call myself a psychic.

336
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm not a criminal.

337
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,660
I'd be careful with how you phrase things if I were you.

338
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,170
All right, I have a question.

339
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,410
Go ahead.

340
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,890
Do you actually have spiritual powers?

341
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,630
No comment.

342
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,420
Recording

343
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,420
Why won't you answer?

344
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,240
Because you won't be satisfied unless I say "no."

345
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,640
I can't prove that I have spiritual powers since you all lack them yourselves.

346
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,180
Are you really going to try to talk your way out of this?

347
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,550
Judging from the broadcast the other day,

348
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,010
you do seem like you're excellent at ad-libbing.

349
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,480
Tch.

350
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,410
Oh? Did you just click your tongue?

351
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,780
No, I was just testing the mics.

352

Uh-oh, now he's copping an attitude.

355
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,620
This guy's finished.

364
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,720
About four years ago.

365
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,440
What were you doing prior to that?

366
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,290
I worked at some company.

367
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,230
Did that company have anything to do with psychics?

368
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,870
No, not at all.

369
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,970
He's actually answering the questions.

370
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,210
What kind of problems did people come to you with?

371
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,530
Stiff shoulders, spirit photos, and stuff.

372
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,330
Did they see any results?

373
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,850
Those cases have been solved.

374
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,180
Any particular case that stands out?

375
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,810
Getting rid of some urban legends.

376
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,730
Have you ever had any conflicts with your clients?

377
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,540
I have not.

378
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,550
Have you ever sold any expensive salt or prayer beads?

379
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,950
I have not.

380
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,730
Apparently, information about when you were a student is spreading over the Internet.

381
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,950
That doesn't matter.

382
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,230
According to your graduation essay, you wrote this...

383
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,670
"I want to be somebody."

384
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,550
What made you get into the psychic business?

385
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,050
Why?

386
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,890
Reigen-san looks pretty pale...

387
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,100
D-Don't keep making the media outlets your enemy.

388
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,060
How wonderful. He's at a loss for words.

389
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,110
Something's wrong. He doesn't have his usual zing.

390
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,120
Great Master Reigen...

391
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,320
What's wrong?

392
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,530
Why did I decide to live as a psychic?

393
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,330
It's not like it's lucrative, and it's usually troublesome.

394
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,180

there was a time when I always did everything efficiently

400
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,210
and was filled with curiosityabout everything.

401
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,920
But then I got bored, quit my job, and rented that office on a whim.

402
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,470
I ended up getting into this facade of a job because of an ad I saw in a magazine.

410
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,570
Man, I'm bored.

411
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,510
As it stands, I'm no different from a masseur.

412
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,280
Guess it's about time to wrap things up.

413
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,910
I wonder what I should do next.

414
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,560
Being a PI sounds pretty fun,

415
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,000
but maybe not, since apparently they mostly do investigations on cheating spouses.

416
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,470
Excuse me.

417
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,470
I came here because I saw your sign.

418
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,600
Sure thing.

419
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,510
How may I help you?

420
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,550
Er... Oh, it's just a kid.

421
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,630
What do you want, boy?

422
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,010
Um, I'm an esper.

423
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,560
Wha?

424
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,620
There are times when I can't control my powers very well,

425
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,790
and it's scary.

426
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,620
You shitty little brat. This must be a prank.

427
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,070
Did someone tell you to come here and tell me that?

428
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,330
No. I haven't been able to talk to anyone about this.

429
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,990
I thought you might be the same as me...

430
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,450
If I tried, I could see spirits, too.

431
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,410
A pathological liar? No, maybe it's an overactive imagination.

432
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Either way, he seems rather troubled by this.

433
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,470
Well, come on in.

434
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,720
Okay.

435
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,550
I was troubled a lot when I was a kid, too.

436
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,350
What's with this kid?

437
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,930
He's staring at me with eyes brimming with hope.

438
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,930
This is serious.

439
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,890
This kid's in his own fantasy world.

440
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,820
I'll just come up with something to get him to go home.

441
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,250
Listen. Just because you have psychic powers

442
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,700
doesn't make you any less human.

443
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,180
It's the same as people who are fast, people who are book smart,

444
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,140
and people with strong body odor.

445
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,210
Psychic powers are just another characteristic.

446
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,740
You must embrace that as a part of yourself and continue to live positively.

447
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,630
The truth behind one's charm is kindness.

448
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,590
Become a good person. That is all.

449
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,550
May I come to talk to you again?

450
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,260
Yeah, I don't know about that. I'm pretty busy, you know?

451
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,520
Anyway, you should go home for tod— Hot!

452
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,980
Hey, don't get bur—

453
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:40,030
Hey... You said you could see ghosts, too, right?

454
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,920
Do you know how to exorcise them, too?

455
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,410
All right. Come again tomorrow around the same time.

456
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,910
What? Really?

457
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,920
I'll show you how to use your powers.

458
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,050
Back then, I couldn't help but admire this kid that walked into my life.

459
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,040
I wanted to grasp something for myself, too.

460
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,930
I wanted to become someone special.

461
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,390
Yet this is the result.

462
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,870
I haven't changed at all since then.

463
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,470
I just kept using him.

464
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,190
In the end, I couldn't become anything.

465
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,860
Maybe I was the one who was holding him back from his youth the most.

466
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,580
Man, I said something really awful back then.

467
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,170
He wanted to change, and yet I tried to cage him in.

468
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,120

That doesn't answer anything!

473
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,150
What kind of answer is that?!

474
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,720
What was that silence?

CG technology is getting incredible lately  #Press

489
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,060
Where's this press conference being held?

490
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,170
O-Our cameras!

491
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,630
Spirit

492
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,630
I-Is Reigen doing this?!

493
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,850
Telekinesis?!

494
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,300
Such incredible power!

495
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,680
Naritasan

496
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,680
That doesn't seem like Reigen-san.

497
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,300
This is getting serious...

498
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,570
Nii-san! Nii-san!

499
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,600
How can you remain so calm?!

500
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,980
Are you the one doing this?!

501
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,160
P-Please do something!

502
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,980
Is this due to your spiritual powers?

503
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Gee, I wonder what's going on.

504
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,270
Please, stop this!

505
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,930
What the hell's going on?!

506
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,160
Are you done asking me if I'm a fraud or not?

507
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,620
In that case, I'll be ending this press conference.

508
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,810
H-Hey!

509
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,340
What's going to happen to us?!

510
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,600
Beats me.

511
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,900
You should probably concentrate on finding your next big story.

512
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,140
One of the lights fell!

513
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,890
One moment please

514
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,600
Cola

515
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,760
What the hell was that? Such bullshit.

516
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,730
Cornered~True Identity~

517
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,920
Why... are you here?

518
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,170
Just because.

519
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,170
Let's get the hell out of here. They're gonna be running around for a while.

520
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,760
Hey... Do you know?

521
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,920
Know what?

522
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,520
What I really am...

523
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,310
Haven't you seen any of the stuff on the web or magazines?

524
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,910
I've always known... from the beginning.

525
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,980
What my master really is...

526
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,790
is a genuinely good guy.

527
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,520
Man, I'm starving.

528
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,880
Let's have some ramen and head home.

529
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,650
Okay.

530
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,450
Oh, by the way, Master, happy birthday.

531
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,120
Mob's finally telling Tsubomi-chan how he really feels about her?

532
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,910
And he's going to try to place within the top 10 in a marathon?

533
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,920
Welp, looks like he's going to need my help.

534
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,540
Next time on Mob Psycho 100 II Episode 8:

535
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,920
"Even Then ~Continue Forward~."

536
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,480
First-press limited edition? That is the absolute best decision.

537
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,210
Even Then~Continue Forward~
