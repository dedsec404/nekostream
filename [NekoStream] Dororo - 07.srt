1
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:29,070
You better hope the beast that comes out   of the cave isn't a monster.

2
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,610
Hey, are you hungry?

3
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,700
Guess he has other things to worry about.

4
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,460
Say, you've never laughed before, have you?

5
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,270
Fine, be that way your whole life for all I care.

6
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,400
I'm never going back to my wife.

7
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,650
I want to stay with you forever.

8
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,950
Me too.

9
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,240
Get a room!

10
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,040
Get eaten by a bear! Take this, and this!

11
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,870
Ow.

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,290
What the...

13
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,060
Hey, you all right?

14
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,520
What the heck? Has he lost his mind?

15
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,160
Hyakkimaru!

16
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,170
Come on out!

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,920
Dang it.

18
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,260
It got away.

19
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,930
Hey look, there's a village.

20
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,770
I guess I'll have to regain my energy there.

21
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,400
Party is over

22
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,410
But I still wanna dance

23
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,960
I can't even sleep

24
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,300
Someday, one day my passion's fire will

25
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,720
From the beginning I knew

26
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,470
One day the flames would die out

27
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,180
Hey, I thought I didn't need anything

28
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,810
But even now, I'm so serious

29
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,810
Ah... I still have time to make it

30
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,530
Ah... but I'm gonna burn it up, baby

31
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,320
Sorry darling, it's not that easy

32
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,160
But surely it's not that bad either

33
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,740
Give me fire

34
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,710
Light it up, baby.   I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

35
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,350
Party is over

36
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,100
Sorry darling Hurry up   Ah... I still have time to make it

37
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,020
Sorry darling Hurry up   Ah... I still have time to make it

38
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,690
Give me fire

39
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,150
Light it up, baby.   I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

40
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,910
#7 The story of the Jorogumo silk spider

41
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,380
How wretched I am, I can't even pull myself up.

42
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,130
What a bothersome village.

43
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,430
"TRAVELER'S PASS"

44
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,640
We have guards out to protect the village now.

45
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,640
Protect from what?

46
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,270
-There's been a kidnapper around here. -A kidnapper?

47
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,360
Yeah, our villagers keep disappearing almost nightly.

48
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,650
That's what those watchtowers are for.

49
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,700
You let us know if you see anything suspicious.

50
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,200
Hey.

51
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,660
I bet it's that spider monster kidnapping the villagers.

52
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,210
Seems like a big problem for them.

53
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,090
We could help this village out.

54
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,460
I bet there'd be a good reward, too.

55
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,980
This, I must complete.

56
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,870
Hey, you! Are you okay?

57
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,130
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

58
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,140
Are you sick?

59
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,560
You're as pale as death. Come to my house.

60
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,850
I can give you something to eat. Can you walk?

61
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,650
Yes, I can...

62
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,020
Okay, come with me.

63
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,200
I'll suck out his life force first.

64
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,170
Say, what's your name? I'm Yajiro.

65
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,340
I have none.

66
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,920
You don't? Well then.

67
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,630
There.

68
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,050
Then how about Ohagi?

69
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,890
-Ohagi? -You were lying in a bed of hagi flowers.

70
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,890
Have it your way.

71
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,600
Okay then, Ohagi. You must be hungry.

72
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,100
Eat up.

73
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,440
What's this? Looks nasty.

74
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,070
Go ahead, eat up.

75
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,330
It's good.

76
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,500
Ohagi, if it's okay, tell me where you came from.

77
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,920
It's not, so I won't.

78
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,000
Then why were you lying there?

79
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,380
As if I had a choice.

80
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,880
If I had the strength, I'd leave this place this very second.

81
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,050
Aren't you going to eat?

82
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,260
Huh? Oh...

83
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,390
I just ate before you came.

84
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,730
What's that noise?

85
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,560
Don't mind it, eat up.

86
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,690
I have to go to work. I'll be back by dusk. Eat up and go to sleep.

87
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,570
What a strange human.

88
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,580
It's mine. Don't touch it.

89
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,720
No rice paddies, no fields.

90
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,850
We might not find any food in this village.

91
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,350
What's going on?

92
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,150
Hey, what's that sign say?

93
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,360
It says there's a reward for finding the kidnapper.

94
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,240
Not that it's helping any in finding the kidnapper.

95
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,330
See, told you so.

96
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,750
That reward is ours then!

97
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,750
What, you know who it might be?

98
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,090
After the reward too? I'd stay out of it if I were you.

99
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,340
We're dealing with a monster here.

100
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,760
A monster?

101
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,910
Quiet, quiet! Don't stop, keep working!

102
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,910
I bet the monster only comes out once it gets really dark.

103
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,210
We don't have the energy to search during the day.

104
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,000
Gotta be smart.

105
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,920
Right, let's go.

106
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,090
I guess this is the most I can do on human food.

107
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,720
Sorry, I got off work late.

108
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,060
You stayed up?

109
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,900
I slept. But I woke up because of all the noise outside.

110
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,730
Yeah, another man died out at work in the mountains.

111
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,570
It's hard work out in the hot sun. It's harsh.

112
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,160
Why do you work so hard? Is it worth dying for?

113
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,120
This is a quarry village.

114
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,920
Our lord won't allow us to slow down.

115
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,790
Humans have no freedom.

116
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,210
You look dreadful.

117
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,090
I see you've eaten, but...

118
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,720
A cockroach.

119
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,180
Why did you let it go?

120
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,060
It's okay for humans to die, but not bugs?

121
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,980
Humans and bugs, they're all the same. Life is life.

122
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,450
I've never met a human who speaks like that before.

123
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,860
You're strange.

124
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,240
Am I? Anyways, eat up.

125
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,870
And sleep. That solves everything.

126
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,190
You're not like any man I've met before.

127
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,570
I guess we both are hungry.

128
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,670
Ugh, I'm pooped out.

129
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,340
We walked all night for nothing.

130
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,590
Where's that spider monster hiding?

131
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,300
My brain isn't working anymore. Let's sleep while it's still cool.

132
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,020
Hey, what's that say?

133
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,030
Another man disappeared last night, so the reward went up.

134
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,070
Last night? But there weren't   any signs of monsters.

135
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,580
Maybe I was wrong.   Maybe it's not a monster...

136
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,960
Hey, will the man who takes people away get caught?

137
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,170
Don't worry, he won't get caught.

138
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:02,090
No man of this village would snitch to the lord no matter the reward.

139
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,230
We have nothing else to eat here   but bugs and weeds.

140
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,310
Guess we'll chew on herbs   and rest till night.

141
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,550
Ohagi, you're growing weaker and weaker. Are you...

142
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,520
You left mighty early this morning.

143
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,980
It was still dark, but you didn't even take a torch.

144
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,610
Do you have another job besides the quarry?

145
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,030
Yeah, a bit of a job as the moon sets.

146
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,610
It's actually my main job.

147
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,860
Must be tough.

148
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,120
Ohagi, as far as I can tell, you're sick with something.

149
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,200
But this village has no doctors.

150
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,080
You can't leave this village without a traveler's pass.

151
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,380
But I can get you out of here.

152
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,260
Well, seems like I won't find any young prey here.

153
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,550
I would leave this place if I could.

154
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,350
But I have nothing to pay you with.

155
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,760
I just want you to live.

156
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,310
Yes, that's right.

157
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,730
I'm the same as a cockroach.

158
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,980
Yes, you are. All lives matter just the same.

159
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,030
I don't wish to die, either.

160
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,030
Help me, then.

161
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,410
Gladly. We should go as soon as possible.

162
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,700
Tonight, after the moon sets and before dawn breaks.

163
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,660
Rest until then.

164
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,760
If the kidnapper isn't a monster,   we won't be able to find him.

165
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,340
Anyways, tonight's our last chance.

166
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,260
This will be our last night looking for the monster here.

167
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,430
We might be hungry, but let's do it.

168
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,280
Where are we going? The village exit isn't this way.

169
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,070
There are guards over there. The secret passage is this way.

170
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,320
We'll get there right before dawn.

171
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,330
You'll have to bear with me.

172
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,580
It's tough on a kid to walk two nights on an empty stomach.

173
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,300
Sorry Hyakkimaru, guess we lucked out this time.

174
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,550
We should give up and go...

175
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,600
Ohagi, do you need to rest a little?

176
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,890
Who do you think I am? I could suck the life out of you.

177
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,850
You're the guy we met yesterday.

178
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,150
The boys after the reward.

179
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,110
You again! Have you come to kill me, you little brats!

180
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,410
That voice, in the forest. It's her!

181
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,080
This woman is the spider monster.

182
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,450
I knew she was the kidnapper!

183
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,710
Get away from her, old man. She'll suck you dry.

184
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,380
We can get food if we beat the monster.

185
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,590
Go get her, Hyakkimaru.

186
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,460
Ohagi, a monster?

187
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,930
Don't you get what I'm saying?

188
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,600
That woman is a monster and a kidnapper!

189
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,060
I'm the kidnapper.

190
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,690
I've helped people escape from here.

191
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,150
Ohagi didn't do it.

192
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,610
I don't mind being caught, but please let Ohagi go.

193
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,650
She's sick and weakened.

194
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,660
Sick? Why protect a monster!

195
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,660
So you're the one behind it all. We finally got you.

196
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,250
We're the ones that found him. We can have that reward, right?

197
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,670
Yeah, right. We just said that to lure any squealers.

198
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,630
That's too cruel.

199
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,380
That's dirty, you guys are villains!

200
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,390
Fine with us.

201
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:20,100
If we lose any more workers and work slows down, our heads will go flying.

202
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,020
Catch that man!

203
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,450
Tastes disgusting.

204
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,460
Bro...

205
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,340
I see you won't let me go.

206
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,050
Don't just stand there. Your job isn't done yet. Which way?

207
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,180
-That way! -Okay.

208
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,730
Hyakkimaru, stay still for a bit.

209
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,150
I was wrong about the reward, so what now?

210
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,860
I'm with ya!

211
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,710
What, you're scared? They'll catch up to us if we walk.

212
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,710
I'm fine.

213
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,420
Then here we go.

214
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,590
Ready?

215
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,270
You're all in good health now, it seems.

216
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,730
You won't need me anymore, huh.

217
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,190
I'm not strong enough to cross the mountain.

218
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,440
I need to suck out 5 or 6 more men's life force.

219
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,610
Do you kill them?

220
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,290
Humans are precious prey. I don't take their lives.

221
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,210
If they're alive, their life force revives.

222
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,790
Then I suck it out again. Living together is the secret to a long life.

223
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,710
I see. From now on too, right?

224
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,050
Yeah.

225
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,050
Good.

226
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,680
Hyakkimaru!

227
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,400
Not even you could climb this.

228
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,520
We'll just have to go after them. Let's go.

229
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,450
This is the secret passage?

230
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,910
It's small here, but wider inside.

231
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,740
Hear that water?

232
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,620
Follow it and you'll reach the stream on the other side.

233
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,250
It's a natural cave.

234
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,340
You won't need a light. They'll never catch you.

235
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,590
My job is done. Now go.

236
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,470
You're coming, too.

237
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,100
You can't stay here now that they know your identity.

238
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,100
Think of what they'll do to you.

239
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,600
Yes, they'll use me to warn people.

240
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,980
Is that what you want?

241
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,280
-No... -Then let's escape.

242
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,610
Don't want to be with a monster?

243
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,280
Okay, Ohagi.

244
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,500
Instead of dying here in this village, I'll live on as your prey.

245
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,170
I'll never meet a human as strange as you again.

246
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,090
Then let's go...

247
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,550
No!

248
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,010
That's what happens when you betray the lord.

249
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,850
Kill him together with the monster woman!

250
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,600
You bastards!

251
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,790
I'll drain every drop of your life force!

252
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,970
Hyakkimaru!

253
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,060
There's no doctor here, right?

254
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,270
Then I will take you to one.

255
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,400
I won't let you die.

256
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,780
I see one of us will have to die.

257
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,790
No, don't kill...

258
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:59,500
Ohagi, you never have, and you never will, right?

259
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,570
They're gone now.

260
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,200
A ghoul that likes a human, huh.

261
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,960
The world's full of surprises.

262
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,750
But it's a good thing your hearing was back.

263
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,960
Or else it would've ended in a really awkward way.

264
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,300
Still don't want to speak?

265
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,850
Fine, I'll talk enough for two and cheer things up.

266
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,390
Huh? A spider, ouch!

267
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,980
It bit me!

268
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,490
Sorry, I'm the one that scared you, huh.

269
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,490
Hey, did you just...

270
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,280
You laughed at me!

271
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,870
I heard that, your first laugh!

272
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,660
But that's not the kind I wanted to hear.

273
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,460
Not the kind that makes fun of people.

274
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,420
A happier laugh, you know?

275
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,900
Sorrow scatters in the wind,

276
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,700
piling up to form shadows

277
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:55,410
Our footsteps admonish   indifference in such verbose ways

278
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,960
As I peek into your fathomless eyes,   I lose my composure

279
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:07,920
Is there any hope   in the place I am heading to?

280
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,180
I feign amusement and laugh

281
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,470
because this road is so dark

282
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:22,190
I will be there to shine the light

283
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,690
I'm used to playing at saying goodbye,

284
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,820
but I cried when I waved to you

285
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:35,120
Our fiery woes fade... and fade...   until night falls upon us

286
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,620
If I knew tomorrow would be so mundane,

287
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,830
I wouldn't have said that I wanted to live

288
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,550
I know it's futile but can't help dreaming   of a future... a future... you are to blame

289
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,850
"Jorogumo"
