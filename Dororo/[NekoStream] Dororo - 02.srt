1
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,390
Back in those days,   to travel meant to risk your life.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,850
You could get lost or robbed.

3
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,900
Injuries or illnesses could   easily prove fatal.

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,190
So it was not uncommon for travelers to   vanish without trace.

5
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,880
You want...?

6
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,090
You want...?

7
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,550
Oh? My, my.

8
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,270
Party is over

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,400
But I still wanna dance

10
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,190
I can't even sleep

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,410
Someday, one day my passion's fire will

12
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,700
From the beginning I knew

13
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,370
One day the flames would die out

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,250
Hey, I thought I didn't need anything

15
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,840
But even now, I'm so serious

16
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,800
Ah... I still have time to make it

17
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,430
Ah... but I'm gonna burn it up, baby

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,270
Sorry darling, it's not that easy

19
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,150
But surely it's not that bad either

20
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,770
Give me fire

21
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,740
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,210
Party is over

23
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,090
Sorry darling Hurry up   Ah... I still have time to make it

24
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,970
Sorry darling Hurry up   Ah... I still have time to make it

25
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,640
Give me fire

26
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,100
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

27
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,860
#2 The story of Bandai

28
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,710
You can see. I knew it.

29
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,250
You can see, right?

30
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,670
How else could you fight a monster like you just did?

31
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,760
You were so cool. You shouldn't let it go to waste.

32
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,220
You could...

33
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,850
Hey, are you listening?

34
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,060
Do you go around slaying monsters?

35
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,940
How is that sword fixed to your arm?

36
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,020
And this.

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,860
It fell off your face,   and some new skin grew.

38
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,360
This thing is fake,

39
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,870
but your new skin is real, isn't it?

40
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,160
How'd you do that?

41
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,250
Hey, you listening?

42
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,760
I knew you could see.

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,050
What, you don't want to talk to me?

44
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,350
Why...

45
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,600
Woah! I'm sorry, I'll get off your case.

46
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Wow.

47
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,790
Woah! Stop, stop.

48
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,830
You shouldn't eat it raw. Wait a sec.

49
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,230
How about it? Smells good, huh?

50
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,700
It'd be even better with salt.

51
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,240
But this'll do. Here ya go.

52
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,790
Sometimes it seems like you really can't see.

53
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,550
You can't hear or talk, either.

54
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,800
You're so strange, you know that?

55
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,430
Oh well.

56
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,230
Don't you want to make some money?

57
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,810
Leave it to me, and I'll make you rich. You could even be a millionaire.

58
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,150
You think so too, that's why you don't shoo me away.

59
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,780
Hyakkimaru could not see nor hear Dororo.

60
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,700
But there was something   he could "see" ever since he was born.

61
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,500
The fire of the soul, shall we say.

62
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,960
The key was the color.

63
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,590
Hostility, hatred,   and beings not of this world.

64
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,970
Hyakkimaru detected such dangers   by their colors.

65
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:54,220
As well as this power, he also possessed   superhuman senses and strength.

66
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,060
This was how he survived the darkness   in which he lived.

67
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,900
Hyakkimaru let Dororo stay close,

68
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,150
only because the color of his soul   did not indicate danger.

69
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,150
Even so...

70
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,450
Here. This small one's for me because I cooked it for you.

71
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,500
This soul didn't pass him by,   but remained close.

72
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,960
It was the second soul to do so.

73
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,910
Stop...

74
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,870
Don't...

75
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,000
Mama!

76
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,880
Did I say something in my sleep?

77
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,720
Oh yeah.

78
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,220
You can't hear me.

79
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,850
Can't you at least tell me your name?

80
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,110
I'm Dororo. Do-ro-ro.

81
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,200
You?

82
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,330
Guess not. You're Mr. No-name then.

83
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,580
Goodnight.

84
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,890
Hey!

85
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,890
Listen up!

86
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,900
I just heard about something that we could make money with.

87
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,150
It seems like there's a monster haunting a village.

88
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:17,160
Villagers and travelers who stop by disappear now and then.

89
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,370
You're going to beat it like you did before and get a reward.

90
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,710
We save people and get money doing it. Great, huh?

91
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,600
Seems like a pretty rich village.

92
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,060
There's really a monster here?

93
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,230
Did somebody say monster?

94
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,440
What about a monster?

95
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,190
Don't assume I don't know.

96
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,650
We heard you're in trouble.

97
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,620
Got some great news for ya.

98
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,330
This guy right here is the best at slaying monsters.

99
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,250
How about it?

100
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,080
Can he really do it?

101
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,710
As sure as anything.

102
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,090
Just the other day, he beat up this huge monster into little bits.

103
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,630
I saw it with my own eyes.

104
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,970
So how about it? Can't hurt to give us a shot.

105
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,230
Got nothing to lose, right?

106
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,980
How fortunate that you came.

107
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,690
If you'll slay it for us, the village will do much to repay you.

108
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,860
Right, everyone?

109
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,820
I like the way you talk, Chief.

110
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,370
I'm just filling in for the chief. My name is Denkichi.

111
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,580
Our chief's name is Bandai.

112
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,920
She has injured her legs and can't move.

113
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,800
Anyways, please feel free to stay at my home.

114
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,340
I don't have much to offer, but would you like some supper?

115
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,600
I really like the way you talk.

116
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,310
Come this way.

117
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,940
This is like paradise.

118
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,860
I haven't eaten so much for ages.

119
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,280
But they're pretty flashy for a village troubled by a monster.

120
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,700
They don't have a lot of rice paddies, either.

121
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,170
How do they make so much money?

122
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,930
Monster!

123
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,100
Monster, right over there!

124
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,730
In front of you, get him!

125
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,860
Hey, come on, hurry.

126
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,070
You want...?

127
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,700
See? He wants to fight. Hold on, you'll get what you want.

128
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,620
Hurry, take your arm off.

129
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,370
Come on...

130
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,080
Hurry up!

131
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,750
What? Hey, it's leaving!

132
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,010
Hurry...

133
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,140
Aww, jeez! It's gone.

134
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,980
Is something the matter?

135
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,140
Did you see the monster?

136
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,150
Yeah, but we let it go for today. Don't worry, we can handle it.

137
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,530
Is that so?

138
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,000
Good morning. Are you awake?

139
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,500
Lady Bandai wishes to meet you two.

140
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,840
Bandai? Oh yeah, the village chief.

141
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,600
Yes, sorry we haven't even prepared your breakfast yet.

142
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,390
Sure, no problem.

143
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,770
That is her residence.

144
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,190
Wow.

145
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,070
Good day.

146
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,410
Huh? It's really dark in here.

147
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,240
I shall light a candle.

148
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,620
Forgive me for being like this.

149
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I can't use my legs.

150
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,760
I am Bandai, the chief of this village.

151
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,470
Do I have something on my face, child?

152
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,470
N-No, it's just you're really pretty.

153
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,520
Oh my, thank you.

154
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,350
Forgive me for calling you to me.

155
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,560
I heard about you from the villagers and had to meet you.

156
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,230
Especially you.

157
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,570
I thought you might be, and I was right.

158
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,610
Huh? You know him?

159
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,710
What are you doing?

160
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,840
Hey, what's the matter?

161
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,800
She's a human.

162
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,420
Hey, stop it! What the heck?

163
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,760
-Lady Bandai! -He's got a sword for an arm!

164
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,390
Seize him!

165
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,060
Stop it, she's no monster.

166
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,020
Please stop!

167
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,230
-Watch it! -Don't move.

168
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,770
Take the boy, too.

169
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,940
Hey, let go!

170
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,060
Take them to the storehouse.

171
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,710
What the heck? And you didn't do anything to last night's monster.

172
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,460
She was a kind-looking lady.

173
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,210
You really can't see, can ya!

174
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,680
You don't see nothing!

175
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,010
It's quite lively today.

176
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm glad to have some companions.

177
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,350
Did you get caught too, Priest?

178
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,230
I heard there was a monster so I came to see, and they locked me up in my sleep.

179
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,360
Why?

180
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,370
Who knows? It could be a clue to where all the people disappeared.

181
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,540
But anyways, I've seen you before somewhere.

182
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,250
Really? You can see?

183
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,130
We see some things people with sight can't see.

184
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,130
Sometimes, it's much more accurate, too.

185
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,390
You see things we can't see?

186
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,640
For example, you look like a clear white flame to me.

187
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,140
Flame?

188
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,360
Your soul, so to speak.

189
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,030
We see what's on the inside, not the outside.

190
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,030
Soul? Inside?

191
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,030
You mean this Mr. No-name can see the way you do too?

192
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,410
Maybe.

193
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,000
So when he drew his sword back there...

194
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,290
Now what?

195
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,290
Watch out.

196
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,750
I sense something strange.

197
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,510
I can't see.

198
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,510
Don't worry, we can't see anyway.

199
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,990
What's happening? What was that voice?

200
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,200
Come with me.

201
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,740
It seems like this well is connected to the outside.

202
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,370
I can't see!

203
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,540
No! I'm scared...

204
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,040
Don't worry. Feel that draft?

205
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,040
Huh? This place...

206
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,460
There's your friend right there.

207
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,970
Have you come to attack me again?

208
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,640
Me, a sick woman. Why?

209
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,480
Give it up. We only see what's inside of you.

210
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,520
What color?

211
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,980
Let's see.

212
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:30,360
What I see now is the murky color of blood. The worst color of all.

213
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,780
It's too bad I couldn't eat you the first time.

214
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,460
I'm sure you've realized it, but this is something worse than a ghoul.

215
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,720
-It's a demon. -A demon?

216
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,100
Doesn't that hurt?

217
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,690
Lady Bandai, run!

218
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,490
Hey, why'd you let it get away!

219
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,580
What the heck is going on?

220
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,000
You knew about it, didn't you?

221
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,040
You knew, and you fed the travelers to it.

222
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,760
I had to, or else it would've eaten up the villagers.

223
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,340
That's why you wanted us to slay it, right?

224
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,010
If we defeat it, then your problem's solved.

225
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,520
It seems like it wasn't Bandai that he wanted slayed.

226
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,430
I knew it. You...!

227
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,560
To think you were still alive.

228
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,480
It must be because "it" failed to take you.

229
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,270
"It" was the only one that couldn't get you.

230
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,610
Have you come to get the rest back?

231
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,070
Interesting. Let's see if you can...

232
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,870
Lady Bandai...

233
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,340
You want...?

234
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,630
It's him.

235
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,300
What's that?

236
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,140
Look, lots of money!

237
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,390
Wow.

238
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,230
The money of the travelers you let Bandai eat, right?

239
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,440
What do you mean?

240
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,940
Our village has nothing to make money with.

241
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,320
We thought everything was lost when the monster Bandai took over.

242
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,700
But the first traveler Lady Bandai ate had a lot of road money on him.

243
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,540
And you couldn't stop.

244
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,540
Seriously? You guys are awful!

245
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,300
Even worse than monsters.

246
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,090
Stop that sound, please!

247
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,310
Is that sound what you wanted us to slay?

248
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,980
It's the sound of the bell that the first traveler carried...

249
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,230
A pilgrim's bell.

250
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,030
Sorry for saying that stuff to you when you tried to kill Bandai.

251
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,950
I was the one who was blind.

252
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,080
You can't hear me.

253
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,460
He knows.

254
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,300
Don't let it get to you. It's natural for those with sight to be tricked.

255
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,300
She looked like her.

256
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,890
Like my dead mama.

257
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,810
I see.

258
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,830
Huh, what now?

259
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,710
Stop treating me like a kid, you No-name!

260
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,420
You can write?

261
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,630
Hey Priest, what did he write?

262
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,430
Let me feel it.

263
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,640
Hya-kki-maru. So that's your name.

264
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,850
Really? Hyakkimaru.

265
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,860
I finally know your name. Hyakkimaru.

266
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,610
I know now, too.   No wonder I remember seeing you.

267
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,000
It was you on the river.

268
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,130
What? Disquiet by the borders?

269
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,300
Yes, they've increased the number of soldiers on guard.

270
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,010
As if readying for war.

271
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,180
Impossible. The Sakai Clan are our allies, not just our neighbors.

272
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,820
I need you to investigate something.

273
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,580
What's wrong?

274
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,920
Hey, are you in pain? Are you okay?

275
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,880
Hang in there!

276
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,960
What's going on?

277
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,930
"Bandai"
