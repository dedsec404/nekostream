1
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,560
Party is over

2
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,390
But I still wanna dance

3
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,980
I can't even sleep

4
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,450
Someday, one day my passion's fire will

5
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,620
From the beginning I knew

6
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,160
One day the flames would die out

7
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,120
Hey, I thought I didn't need anything

8
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,750
But even now, I'm so serious

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,800
Ah... I still have time to make it

10
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,350
Ah... but I'm gonna burn it up, baby

11
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,180
Sorry darling, it's not that easy

12
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,850
But surely it's not that bad either

13
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,520
Give me fire

14
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,480
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

15
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,210
Party is over

16
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,050
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it

17
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,880
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it

18
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,510
Give me fire

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,100
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,940
#5 The story of the Moriko Song, part 1

21
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,970
Hey!

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,880
Hyakkimaru.

23
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,470
Hey.

24
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,600
You okay?

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,770
Still too noisy for you, huh?

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,860
But it's so quiet here it creeps me out.

27
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,410
Sound.

28
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,120
It was the most shocking sense that Hyakkimaru had so far recovered.

29
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,540
It reverberated relentlessly in his head.

30
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,840
He knew not how to select which of the innumerable sounds to listen to.

31
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,340
Hyakkimaru drowned in the flood of sound.

32
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,810
Hey, maybe we should give up on going after the next monster.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,940
The reward is handsome, but you're just not fit for it.

34
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,610
Is something there?

35
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,910
The bird monster! It's huge!

36
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,560
Hyakkimaru, don't worry about the sound!

37
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,280
Your left!

38
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,700
Watch out!

39
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,930
Priest!

40
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,900
Oh, it was you two? What a coincidence.

41
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,570
Hey, hey.

42
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,650
Come on, snap out of it.

43
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,160
What's wrong with you?

44
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,160
Hey...

45
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,750
I see, his ears eh? Good for him.

46
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,090
It's not good.

47
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,800
He's gotten weaker now that he can hear.

48
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,930
How so?

49
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,430
I mean, he got beat up by that ghoul that even you could kill.

50
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,560
Well, thank you.

51
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,770
He'll be all right, won't he?

52
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,150
He's gotten past the worst of it.

53
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,570
We could use some medicine, if only we had any.

54
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,150
I'll go run and find some.

55
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,570
There's a big town across the river.

56
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,410
You better not. I heard there's a war brewing. It's dangerous.

57
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,880
Seems like the Sakai clan, who rules this area, betrayed an ally.

58
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,590
The 2 armies have their swords drawn.

59
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,430
For strangers like us to go near them now would be suicidal.

60
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,350
That's why I turned back and came across you two.

61
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,480
Dang it, why do samurai like to fight so much?

62
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,690
Sorry, that was too loud, huh.

63
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,610
Don't move, now. Your wounds will open up.

64
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,860
Dear, dear.

65
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,740
You're like a wounded beast hiding in his cave.

66
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,330
Hear this? This is a human's voice.

67
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,830
The other sounds are the creatures in the woods, the fire, and the wind.

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,130
You have to get used to it.

69
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,760
To come out of your cave and live in this world.

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,220
Hyakkimaru.

71
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,010
He's hurt. Don't force him like that.

72
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,890
He needs time to get used to it.

73
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,590
What a gentle voice.

74
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,420
You shouldn't get up yet.

75
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,050
Dear, dear.

76
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,850
I can't eat this tough meat.

77
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,940
Oh, the red flower

78
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,950
In her hair

79
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,660
It blooms and sways

80
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,460
Like the sun...

81
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,720
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

82
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,230
Oh, you can't see.

83
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,270
See? I'm right here.

84
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,820
What's wrong?

85
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,530
You must have a fever.

86
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,360
You shouldn't be in the water. Come.

87
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,120
Oh no, hang on there.

88
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,240
Hey!

89
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,930
I've never seen him so weak before.

90
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,180
It must be because of his wounds.

91
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,730
But he's also regained many things from the demons.

92
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,940
Maybe he's having trouble adjusting.

93
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,940
Here are some old rags, but they're clean.

94
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,990
-Thanks. -Mio, was it?

95
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,360
Forgive us for causing you so much trouble.

96
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,540
Not at all. Please stay until he's better.

97
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,620
Can we?

98
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,000
Of course. There are lots of people here like your big brother.

99
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,750
We're all used to it.

100
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,630
Don't be shy, say hello kids.

101
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,560
There was a terrible war.

102
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,070
We lost our houses and everything we had.

103
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,650
So we all live together here.

104
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,160
So none of them have dads or moms?

105
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,370
Right. But they're all wonderful children.

106
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,660
We make do somehow, even though they're all young.

107
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,880
Sis Mio, you're still up?

108
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,250
Come out, out you guys.

109
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,590
Sis Mio, you better get some sleep while you can.

110
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,590
I'll watch over the hurt guy, so you go to sleep.

111
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,100
Okay, okay.

112
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,310
If you need anything, ask Takebo here.

113
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,440
Hurry up. I made breakfast so eat it before you sleep.

114
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,850
I will, I will.

115
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,110
There's some for you guys, too.

116
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,860
Potato gruel. Eat up.

117
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,120
T-Thanks.

118
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,790
You need help?

119
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,880
Nah, you watch over your guy.

120
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,430
I can't just sit here and do nothing in return.

121
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,390
At least let me work for how much you feed us.

122
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,970
You're a good guy, huh.

123
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,140
Even though you cried like a baby over your guy.

124
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,400
I did not! Not even a drop.

125
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,570
Shh, you'll wake Sis Mio.

126
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,240
Sorry, but why is she sleeping now?

127
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,490
Because she works during the night.

128
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,580
The Sakai army can't say when the war might start up.

129
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,500
So somebody has to serve them all through the night.

130
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,960
Besides, the pay is better during the night.

131
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,500
Sis Mio works hard, so she even gets food.

132
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,630
So we have to let her sleep during the day.

133
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,140
You're a pretty good guy too, huh.

134
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,140
Where are you off to, Priest?

135
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,770
I'm going to look for a path where we can avoid the battlefield.

136
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,520
I won't be gone long.

137
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,860
But if I don't return, it means I've found some little path to sneak out of.

138
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,150
Okay.

139
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,700
Huh? He's not with you guys?

140
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,950
We just meet sometimes. He's weird.

141
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,580
I wonder if there's going to be another war.

142
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,080
Who knows?

143
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,540
I guess we can't stay here either. Damn.

144
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,010
Sakai's army at the border hasn't made a move. It's a deadlock.

145
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,220
If this lasts any longer, we'll have to send more provisions.

146
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,470
We must have enough for that.

147
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,270
Yes, but...

148
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,360
It hasn't rained for almost a month now.

149
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,860
It's uncommon to be so dry during this season.

150
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,870
We should store up, just in case.

151
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,660
There will be no bad harvests on my land.

152
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,910
Sir...

153
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,620
How can you be so sure?

154
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,000
My lady.

155
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,540
Trouble with Lord Sakai, and now this drought.

156
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,220
We had a landslide this year, too.

157
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,010
It's like we've gone back to the past.

158
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,810
What are you saying?

159
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,390
You, I, this domain. We all sit atop a small cornerstone.

160
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,520
Please do not forget that.

161
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,400
It could crumble and fall any day.

162
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,700
The hell with Sakai.

163
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,700
-Take care of matters quickly. -Yes, my lord.

164
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,430
Go, go, go!

165
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,600
Swish, swish!

166
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,560
Kids.

167
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,070
Stop giggling and help out.

168
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,580
Hyakkimaru, how are you feeling?

169
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,080
You still have a fever.

170
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,250
I'll get you some medicine tonight.

171
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,010
I'm sure Lord Sakai's army has some.

172
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,470
I'll be going to work then.

173
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,600
Supper will be ready in a bit.

174
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,320
Pick a red flower

175
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,370
To give to her

176
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,040
In her hair

177
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,210
You...

178
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,810
You creatures know the safe paths better than us humans.

179
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,150
This way, then.

180
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,200
This is quite a nice place.

181
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,100
What are you doing out here?

182
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,730
Medicine? Don't worry, here.

183
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,230
I'll brew it for you.

184
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,990
How strange. It feels like you can see.

185
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,870
Down deep inside of me.

186
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,500
He can. He sees the color of your soul.

187
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,710
Don't you leave like that.

188
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,380
You scared me.

189
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,800
Color of the soul?

190
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,470
Yeah, I don't get it very much either.

191
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,090
But he can see the colors of the souls of living things.

192
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,930
Not just people. Grass, trees, animals. He can find ghouls easily, too.

193
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,650
I bet they've got a really gross color.

194
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,900
I see...

195
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,320
What?

196
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,410
Maybe he wants to hear you sing.

197
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,450
Sing?

198
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,120
Seems like your song doesn't bother him.

199
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,790
Hey! If he listens to you sing, he'll get used to sound.

200
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,920
He's like a hurt beast in a cave right now.

201
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,260
Draw him out of it with your song.

202
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,390
My song isn't that great...

203
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,310
Okay then.

204
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,690
Pick a red flower

205
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,280
To give to her

206
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,710
In her hair

207
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:30,800
I will put the flower

208
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,840
Oh, the priest.

209
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,430
No paths out?

210
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,430
Nah, I have some good news and some bad news.

211
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,810
Sound like a great place!

212
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,190
You'll be safe there even if a war starts.

213
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,820
I licked the soil, and it seemed good.

214
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,240
Let's go, Sis Mio. Let's live there.

215
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,490
Yes...

216
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,700
But not so fast.

217
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,750
Something already owns that land.

218
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But you said it was a vacant lot.

219
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,920
A demon.

220
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,340
It's not something we want to mess with lightly.

221
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,430
Aww, man.

222
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,850
You mean, a ghoul?

223
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,140
It's way stronger than just any old ghoul.

224
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,350
I see.

225
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,940
Hey, you're not going out there to get it, are you?

226
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,900
Wait, you can't with that injury.

227
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,030
Priest!

228
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,990
Though I told you knowing you'd go there,

229
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,290
I didn't think you'd go before your wounds are healed.

230
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,950
You just can't wait, huh?

231
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,040
Priest, take care of him for me!

232
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,670
I'll try harder, too.

233
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,190
We really must watch over him.

234
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,230
You're going to work for the enemy, too?

235
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,610
You mean, you're going to work for both sides?

236
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,400
Yes, starting tonight.

237
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,280
That's too dangerous.

238
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,080
Yeah, it's hard enough on you already.

239
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,410
But we need to get ready to move to the new place.

240
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,410
We can't live on an empty lot.

241
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,040
Yeah, but...

242
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,920
Don't worry. War took a lot from us, so let's get it back.

243
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,840
Sis Mio...

244
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,050
I should rest up while I can.

245
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,810
Goodnight, then.

246
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,260
Yeah.

247
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,310
Sis Mio's really stubborn when she wants to be.

248
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,770
But I heard the enemy is pretty rough.

249
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,780
Okay, I'll go with her.

250
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,780
You? Then I'll go too.

251
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,830
No, you must stay with the other kids.

252
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,660
Don't worry, if things get too tough, I'll make her quit.

253
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay, thanks.

254
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,080
Take them back from war, huh.

255
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,800
I like that. We'll take from the samurai, too.

256
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,390
How long are we going to sit here?

257
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,430
I can't make a name for myself.

258
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,560
Yeah, nothing to do here but take a dump.

259
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,900
Sirs.

260
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,780
I'm looking for a job.

261
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,530
Huh? Where'd Mio go?

262
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,370
You see?

263
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,580
You sure about this?

264
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,630
You should wait until you've healed.

265
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,690
That must be it.

266
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,950
Now!

267
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,930
Hyakkimaru!

268
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,660
Hyakkimaru, your voice...!

269
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,990
Sorrow scatters in the wind,

270
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,860
piling up to form shadows

271
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,410
Our footsteps admonish indifference in such verbose ways

272
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:02,040
As I peek into your fathomless eyes, I lose my composure

273
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:08,050
Is there any hope in the place I am heading to?

274
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,220
I feign amusement and laugh

275
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,470
because this road is so dark

276
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:22,190
I will be there to shine the light

277
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,690
I'm used to playing at saying goodbye,

278
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,900
but I cried when I waved to you

279
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:35,120
Our fiery woes fade... and fade... until night falls upon us

280
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,700
If I knew tomorrow would be so mundane,

281
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,920
I wouldn't have said that I wanted to live

282
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,800
I know it's futile but can't help dreaming of a future... a future... you are to blame

283
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,980
"Yocho"
