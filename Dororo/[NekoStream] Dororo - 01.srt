1
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,610
Just a little while longer, my lady.

2
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:39,490
My lady, be strong. Your child will be here any minute now.

3
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,540
"HALL OF HELL"

4
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,050
Sir Daigo?

5
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,010
One who steps into this Hall of Hell has made a choice.

6
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,060
To cast off Buddha and the gods in favor of the demons.

7
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,610
I see it is futile to try and stop you.

8
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,700
But hear me one last time.

9
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,990
Sir Daigo.

10
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,200
To cast off Buddha is to tread the path of evil.

11
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,870
It is to no longer be human.

12
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:14,340
If you cross this line, hell will surely await you.

13
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,800
Priest, we are already living in hell.

14
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,510
The holy path to Buddha you pray for exists nowhere.

15
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,350
You will pay the consequences.

16
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,350
I care not.

17
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,990
I thank you, Sir.

18
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,750
This will be my salvation.

19
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,500
This world is indeed hell, just as you said.

20
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,710
The prayers I offered seemed more and more pointless.

21
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,100
I always feared that some day I would begin to doubt Buddha.

22
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,680
I am glad to die before that day comes.

23
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:13,110
Sir Daigo, please stay away from the demons.

24
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,030
Do not let yourself succumb to evil.

25
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,780
It's too late for that.

26
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,790
12 Demons, I am Daigo Kagemitsu.

27
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,750
Lord of Ishikawa,

28
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,760
and vassal to the governor of Kaga Province.

29
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,890
Repeated famines and epidemics have swept my land,

30
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,970
enfeebling my people to the point of death.

31
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:54,690
As things stand, I shall never attain the power and renown I crave.

32
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,770
My ambitions will remain a mere dream.

33
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,030
But I refuse to rely on the mercy of Buddha or the gods.

34
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,370
What I am about to say to you is not a prayer.

35
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,370
I came to make a deal.

36
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,790
If you'll protect my land and let me rule the country,

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,540
I will give you anything of mine.

38
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,380
Anything. Take whatever you wish.

39
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,340
Do you hear me!

40
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,360
My lady, just a bit more.

41
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,820
Goddess of Mercy, please protect me...

42
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,880
He is born!

43
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,440
What is it?

44
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,100
My lord.

45
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,690
Is the baby born?

46
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,610
-Yes, but... -What? Say it.

47
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,740
He is born, my lord.

48
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,370
He is your son.

49
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,200
-My lady... -An heir, you've done well!

50
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,450
Sir, no...!

51
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,960
I do not know what happened.

52
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,430
He is alive, but has no limbs, eyes, nor a nose.

53
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,470
He doesn't even have any skin.

54
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,720
I will give you anything of mine.

55
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,690
Anything. Take whatever you wish.

56
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,110
My lord, I feel a deep love for this woeful child of ours.

57
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,490
No matter his appearance, he is our son.

58
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,120
My dream will be fulfilled.

59
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,920
-My lord? -The demons agreed to the deal.

60
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,300
You need not worry.

61
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,090
Thank you for bearing him.

62
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,970
What are you doing, stop!

63
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,600
-Wait! -Forget him. He never even existed.

64
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,890
No! Don't!

65
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,100
My lady, you mustn't get up yet.

66
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,980
Please, have mercy.

67
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,230
He wouldn't survive anyway.

68
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,700
Then let him pass away in my arms.

69
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,700
Enough!

70
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,000
You will bear another child. You must.

71
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,630
The next one will be the heir of a great ruler.

72
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,220
What...

73
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,060
It was blown away when the lightning struck.

74
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,430
The midwife said it sacrificed itself.

75
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,390
Sacrifice?

76
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,830
"HALL OF HELL"

77
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,090
Party is over

78
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,340
But I still wanna dance

79
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,100
I can't even sleep

80
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,230
Someday, one day my passion's fire will

81
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,650
From the beginning I knew

82
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,190
One day the flames would die out

83
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,110
Hey, I thought I didn't need anything

84
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,700
But even now, I'm so serious

85
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,700
Ah... I still have time to make it

86
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,250
Ah... but I’m gonna burn it up, baby

87
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,210
Sorry darling, it’s not that easy

88
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,010
But surely it’s not that bad either

89
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,720
Give me fire

90
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,680
Light it up, baby. I’m gonna burn it up, yeah

91
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,120
Party is over

92
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,910
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it

93
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,830
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it

94
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,580
Give me fire

95
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,000
Light it up, baby. I’m gonna burn it up, yeah

96
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,800
#1 The story of Daigo

97
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,680
Whatever could've caused this?

98
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,310
Either way, being alive would only be harder for you.

99
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,370
Now, go on dear. Buddha will take care of you.

100
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,460
I should be used to this sort of thing by now.

101
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,340
Do you desire to live?

102
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,860
The rest is up to your luck, dear boy.

103
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,790
I smell something.

104
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,970
The stench of evil.

105
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,160
What's there?

106
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,660
Not human.

107
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,540
Yet, not a ghoul, either.

108
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,960
I smell a curse.

109
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,270
Daigo Kagemitsu's land at the border of Kaga.

110
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,190
After overcoming many famines, it was on its way to prosperity.

111
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,820
But the tiny soul, too weak to even let out a cry,

112
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,240
quietly vanished off into obscurity.

113
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,830
There was none in the land who knew about it.

114
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,750
16 YEARS LATER

115
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,670
At that time, there was always a war being fought somewhere.

116
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,460
Human lives were hardly worth more than a stone on the ground.

117
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,900
You there.

118
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,360
Are you the doctor who gives prosthetics to the dead to mourn for them?

119
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,530
Your name is Jukai, am I correct?

120
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,370
How worthy of you.

121
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,250
I just figured it'd be better than throwing away the prototypes.

122
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,130
But I'm sure they are grateful for it.

123
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,820
Come, come, take a look. Quality goods, straight from the capital.

124
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,410
This is real silk. A wealthy princess wore it.

125
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,660
Come miss, feel it.

126
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,040
And this is a sake jug from the Yamata no Orochi legend.

127
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,500
All one-of-a-kind quality items.

128
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,920
I'll give you a bargain. I'll even throw in these dried fish.

129
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,510
First come, first served.

130
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,850
Yikes.

131
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,850
Found you, Dororo.

132
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,190
This is the load we were carrying, isn't it?

133
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,980
Got any proof?

134
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,860
Shut up! You said you were starving, so we hired you to look after our goods.

135
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,740
This is your usual trick, we hear.

136
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,160
You little rascal.

137
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,080
Some guys asked me to make sure you paid for it.

138
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,540
It's your fault for being so naive.

139
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,050
You should learn from me.

140
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,050
Right, no more nice guy.

141
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,300
You'll pay for this, just like an adult.

142
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,930
Stop, you little brat! Oops.

143
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,350
Catch me if you can.

144
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,520
-Get back here, dammit! -We'll get you!

145
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,570
Thank you, mister.

146
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,450
Don't just stand there, say thank you.

147
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,790
Is there a festival today, Mama?

148
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,670
Of course not. We just had one not long ago.

149
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,380
But he had a mask on.

150
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,680
Where'd he go, dammit.

151
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,970
What's this?

152
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,970
Oh, crap.

153
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,350
Horse manure!

154
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,810
Wash your faces with those, and come back later.

155
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,570
He's asking for it now.

156
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,160
Ah, that was fun.

157
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,870
Too bad about that load though. That was good stuff.

158
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,670
Oh well. I'll just go for the next fool.

159
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,300
What is it? Can't find your mommy?

160
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,470
You hungry? Oh, all right.

161
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,220
No, I can't. You have to learn how to live on your own now.

162
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,520
It wouldn't do you any good.

163
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,060
Learn how to find your own food.

164
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,360
I'm saying this for your own good.

165
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,070
You're mine now, Dororo.

166
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,320
Hey, let go of him!

167
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Is he yours? Then he'll pay for what you did.

168
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,210
-Stop it. -Then do what we say.

169
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,010
Had enough? Don't you ever steal again.

170
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,560
-You brat! -You asked for it.

171
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,310
Enough.

172
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,940
Never show your face here again, got it?

173
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,740
No.

174
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,160
Nobody orders me around.

175
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,660
I choose where I live!

176
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
You wanna die, huh?

177
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,880
Be my guest!

178
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,220
Bring me that straw mat. I'm wrapping him up.

179
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,810
Okay, Boss.

180
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,780
What are you doing? Hurry up.

181
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,610
Boss, there's some weird guy up there.

182
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,910
Huh?

183
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,910
He's got a face like a doll.

184
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,290
His eyes too. Where's he looking?

185
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,540
Creep.

186
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,380
Hey you, got a problem?

187
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,590
We're not some bullies, you know. We're the ones being bullied.

188
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,380
Hey, you hear me?

189
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,590
What, you wanna fight?

190
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,930
No, I don't think he's looking at us.

191
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,270
Those eyes.

192
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,360
He's looking behind us.

193
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,570
Huh? There's nothing out there.

194
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,210
Just some floating garbage.

195
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,460
What the...

196
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,890
It ate him...?

197
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,050
He's not looking at it!

198
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,390
Wow, that was amazing!

199
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,950
Your face. Those eyes, ears and all are fake, right?

200
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,740
How can you see?

201
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,200
But you can't hear, can ya?

202
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,750
I wouldn't be able to walk a step with my eyes closed.

203
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,170
But you run and jump without using a cane.

204
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,380
How do you do that?

205
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,680
What is it? What's wrong?

206
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,140
Are you hurt?

207
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,860
What's going on? Your skin...

208
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,670
"HALL OF HELL"

209
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,060
What the...

210
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,190
T-This can't be!

211
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,280
Mother!

212
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,660
I hunted a turtledove for you. It will make you strong.

213
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,080
I, Tahomaru, will cook it for you.

214
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,210
How wonderful.

215
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,630
It rained like this that day, too.

216
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,220
My dear son.

217
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,730
Hyakkimaru.

218
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,530
You... Your face...

219
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,160
What's going on?

220
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,660
What are you?

221
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,750
Are you human?

222
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,850
"Deiki"
