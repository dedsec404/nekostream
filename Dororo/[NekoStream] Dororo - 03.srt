1
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,480
Wars had ravaged the land for years.

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,940
The soil was soaked with blood.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,280
The wailings of the bloody survivors   could be heard throughout the land.

4
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,330
Just kill me, now!

5
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,300
Let those who live to rebel take this as a warning.

6
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,350
No dear, no!

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,940
Hang that up there too.

8
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,350
Party is over

9
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,440
But I still wanna dance

10
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,160
I can't even sleep

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,250
Someday, one day my passion's fire will

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,750
From the beginning I knew

13
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,460
One day the flames would die out

14
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,130
Hey, I thought I didn't need anything

15
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,760
But even now, I'm so serious

16
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,720
Ah... I still have time to make it

17
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,480
Ah... but I'm gonna burn it up, baby

18
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,270
Sorry darling, it's not that easy

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,070
But surely it's not that bad either

20
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,700
Give me fire

21
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,620
Light it up, baby. I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

22
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,300
Party is over

23
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,050
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it

24
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,970
Sorry darling Hurry up Ah... I still have time to make it

25
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,640
Give me fire

26
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,110
Light it up, baby.   I'm gonna burn it up, yeah

27
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,860
#3 The story of Jukai

28
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,490
Hey, Kaname.

29
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,120
Hello.

30
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,420
This is for Doc.

31
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,630
Thank you!

32
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,920
It's nothing compared to what he did for us.

33
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,010
Thanks to him, my son can run around again.

34
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,470
This world isn't such a bad place with a man like him around.

35
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,810
Damn right.

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,520
You can move it with your shoulder muscles.

37
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,280
All you'll need is a little practice.

38
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,110
I have an arm!

39
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,700
I'm so happy for you, dear.

40
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,330
You're really letting me have this for free?

41
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,330
I do this because I wish to.

42
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,880
Thank you so much.

43
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,210
Master.

44
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,880
Teach this man how to use his new limb.

45
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,840
Yes!

46
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,130
Next.

47
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,840
Dr. Jukai is like Buddha himself.

48
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,340
Yes, he really is.

49
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,360
Master gave me a reason to live   when I was an orphan.

50
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,860
I'm so happy to be able to work here.

51
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,140
He's been up all night?

52
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,360
It hurts, Mama...

53
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,580
We're almost at the doctor's place. Hang in there.

54
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,870
It hurts!

55
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,460
What's the matter?

56
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,300
Is Dr. Jukai's home close by?

57
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,260
A passing samurai picked a fight with him and cut his arm off.

58
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,680
My poor son...

59
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,310
Don't worry. Master will save him.

60
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,200
It may take some time.

61
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,410
But I'll do everything I can.

62
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,490
Oh doctor, thank you so much.

63
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,120
I'm so relieved, did you hear that?

64
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,210
Yes...

65
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,380
I couldn't thank you enough.

66
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,090
He'll be running around again in no time.

67
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,090
I was afraid the doctor might be a scary man.

68
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,640
But I'm ever so glad I came.

69
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,100
You should never believe rumors.

70
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,970
Rumors?

71
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,180
N-Nothing...

72
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,450
Kaname?

73
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,450
Master.

74
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,120
Is it true?

75
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,630
That you used to serve Lord Shiba?

76
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,850
A foreign ship picked me up after I'd fallen into the sea.

77
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,520
I went with them to their country.

78
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,070
There, I learned how to make prosthetics for those who've lost their limbs.

79
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,570
I dare not say it's to atone for my sins.

80
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,330
But to just die peacefully as if nothing happened...

81
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,870
I didn't think it could be forgiven.

82
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,050
I was supposed to have died, but was made to live.

83
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,470
It meant there was something I still had to do.

84
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,510
During the war with the Shiba clan...

85
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,060
my father was killed.

86
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,480
Father, Father...!

87
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,980
Father!

88
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,450
You... You killed Father!

89
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,700
Kaname.

90
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,710
Please.

91
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,040
Begging for your life after what you did?

92
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,330
I care not for my life.

93
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,840
Do whatever you wish when this job is over. Just...

94
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,840
let me fulfill my promise to that child.

95
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,900
This is for him.

96
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,780
Thank you.

97
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,140
Thank you, Doc!

98
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,770
Farewell!

99
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,320
You could never atone for what you did.

100
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,370
You will never be my salvation.

101
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,350
It can't be... alive?

102
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,900
You wish to live?

103
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,370
"ONE YEAR LATER"

104
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,870
Is it born?

105
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,080
Yes, it is a boy, my lord.

106
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,800
You did it, my lady.

107
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,880
He will be my heir.

108
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,680
"6 YEARS LATER"

109
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,880
Seems like that crab took a liking to you.

110
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,670
Be careful, you'll scratch your mask up.

111
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,300
Here.

112
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,010
Let's take some home for dinner.

113
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,770
Time to head back.

114
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,610
Once again, I was made to live.

115
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:28,160
This boy is missing many body parts   and doesn't seem to hear me.

116
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,670
But, he has a curious power.

117
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,890
The strong power to survive.

118
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,890
"MARU"

119
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,860
This is your name.

120
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,650
"HYAKKIMARU"

121
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,860
There are things in this world more terrifying than a hundred demons.

122
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,370
But don't succumb to them, Hyakkimaru.

123
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,790
You will overcome them.

124
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,750
Hyakkimaru, are you okay?

125
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,880
Just what was that?

126
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,220
What is it?

127
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,730
Monsters.

128
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,200
They must be drawn to his powers.

129
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,960
Hyakkimaru.

130
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,340
I can't protect you forever.

131
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,630
In order for you to survive on your own...

132
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,930
You must be strong.

133
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,900
You win, sir.

134
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,270
Sir Tahomaru, how strong you are!

135
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,360
Yeah, I'm the strongest in this land!

136
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,570
Tahomaru.

137
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,320
Sword practice?

138
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,080
Father!

139
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,950
Oh, put me down.

140
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Mother!

141
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,840
What is it?

142
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,100
Father, tell me about your last war.

143
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,930
Oh, all right.

144
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,250
I must dress his wounds.

145
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,600
He feels no pain, therefore he knows no fear.

146
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,850
He has no hesitation towards slashing and killing.

147
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,400
I only wished for one thing.

148
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,240
For him to overcome his destiny.

149
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,620
And live strongly.

150
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,750
That was all, at first...

151
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,130
Have I made the wrong decision again?

152
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,790
Hyakkimaru, are you okay?

153
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,170
What's the matter?

154
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,090
Hyakkimaru.

155
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,680
Your right leg.

156
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,680
You must've been rough on it.

157
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,180
Are you okay?

158
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,810
What the...

159
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,610
What's going on?

160
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
Impossible.

161
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,410
A leg. A real leg is growing.

162
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,830
How can this be?

163
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:06,640
Ghouls don't just eat people.

164
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,310
At times, they delude humans   and lend them their powers.

165
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:17,780
They let a person benefit   from their supernatural powers.

166
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,110
But in return, they take something away.

167
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,750
It may be that your body was taken   from you in such an arrangement.

168
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,130
I can't go with you. I'd only be in your way.

169
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,880
I couldn't do anything for you.

170
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,430
All I did was teach you to kill.

171
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,190
You had this with you when I found you.

172
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,690
It may help you one day to find your real parents.

173
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:47,950
So if he goes around killing monsters, he'll get his body back?

174
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,200
Yes, I suppose that's what it is.

175
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,080
Somebody must've made a deal with the demons a long time ago.

176
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,420
In return for that boy's body.

177
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,340
That's awful!

178
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,010
I don't know what they got, but his eyes, nose, mouth...

179
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,970
they gave it all away!

180
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,850
One must be prepared to go to hell to do such a thing.

181
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,480
What do these monsters want them for?

182
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,150
A single eye couldn't make their tummies full.

183
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,610
Who knows? Maybe it fulfills their souls.

184
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,910
What's that mean?

185
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,490
Hyakkimaru, you're up.

186
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,490
Huh? Hey.

187
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,040
It's hot, huh?

188
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,500
You've regained your sense of pain.

189
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,340
Stop it, you'll get burnt!

190
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,180
Geez, what do you think you're doing?

191
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,260
You dummy.

192
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,250
I cannot go anywhere.

193
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,130
Hyakkimaru.

194
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,940
Sorrow scatters in the wind,

195
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,740
piling up to form shadows

196
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:55,450
Our footsteps admonish indifference in such verbose ways

197
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:02,000
As I peek into your fathomless eyes, I lose my composure

198
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,970
Is there any hope in the place I am heading to?

199
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,220
I feign amusement and laugh

200
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,510
because this road is so dark

201
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,230
I will be there to shine the light

202
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,730
I'm used to playing at saying goodbye,

203
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,860
but I cried when I waved to you

204
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,160
Our fiery woes fade... and fade... until night falls upon us

205
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,660
If I knew tomorrow would be so mundane,

206
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,870
I wouldn't have said that I wanted to live

207
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,760
I know it's futile but can't help dreaming of a future... a future... you are to blame

208
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:00,020
"Kamaitachi"
