1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,480
The seasonal uniform change!

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,560
It's been so muggy lately, you know?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,570
Even just changing into short sleevesfeels much more comfortable.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,110
Right.

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,540
Relationship advice?

7
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,250
Yes! I don't know what to do.

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,340
But I heard that the student councilgives advice for that kind of thing, too.

9
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,970
KAGUYA WANTS TO HANDLE IT

10
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,390
You're the only one I can count on,Miss Kaguya!

11
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,720
Understood.

12
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,060
The president here often saysthat lending an ear to the students' troubles

13
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,350
is also a duty of the student council.

14
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,850
So,

15
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,360
what's the trouble?

16
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,110
I want to know how to break upsmoothly with my boyfriend.

17
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,870
I thought it would betwo or three steps before that point!

18
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,450
Advice about having a boyfriend.

19
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,460
You're really popular, and I'm sureyou know a lot about love!

20
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,960
But I've never even gone out with anyone,so how could I possibly answer that?

21
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,960
I knew I could come to youfor a great idea!

22
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,970
Her expectations are too high!

23
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,300
But Shinomiya gave romantic advice once,

24
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,640
so there's no wayI can tell her it's beyond me!

25
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,600
I'll just have to get through it somehow!

26
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,350
Why do you want to break up?

27
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,610
Actually, he suddenly asked me out.

28
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,440
Bam!

29
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,150
I said, "Okay" on the spur of the moment,

30
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,530
but I didn't really know him.

31
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,120
And I don't really knowhow to communicate with him either.

32
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,200
In fact, there's more distancebetween us now than before.

33
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,580
I feel guilty about it,

34
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,630
so if it's going to be like this, I figuredmaybe we're better off just breaking up.

35
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,250
I see.

36
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,970
Until just before,you were strangers to each other.

37
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,840
So I can see where you're coming from.

38
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,720
You don't hate him, though, do you?

39
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,480
Of course not. But I don't knowif what I feel for him is love.

40
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,230
Why don't you startby telling me his good points?

41
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,780
What I like about him?

42
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,860
Yes. Everyone has strong pointsor something that's cute about them.

43
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,120
For example, he's honestor he does well academically.

44
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,120
Maybe he studies hardor he's actually really kind

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,580
and can't turn his backon someone who's in trouble.

46
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,340
Maybe he has a menacing look.

47
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,300
A menacing look is a drawback.

48
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,510
No! Being botheredby your own menacing look is cute!

49
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,100
You like boys who have menacing looks?

50
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,600
Forget I said that.

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,890
The only person around youwith a menacing look that I can think of...

52
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,400
That's the wrong idea.Now let's continue.

53
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,110
If you find one good thing about himand start to appreciate that,

54
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,530
you'll soon be able to seemany of his good points,

55
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,990
and the next thing you know,you're unable to take your eyes off of him.

56
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,660
And if you see him every day...

57
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,870
little by little, you'll fall in love.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,670
That's what an acquaintance told me!

59
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,500
I'm not talking about me!

60
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,670
Really?

61
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,300
It's really not about me!

62
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,720
Because there isn't anyoneI'm in love with!

63
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,380
But the way you said it...

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,720
I overheard!

65
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,890
Miss Fujiwara?

66
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,760
It's no fair to have girls' talk without me!

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,350
Please leave an issue like thatto Love Detective Chika!

68
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,350
LOVE DETECTIVE CHIKA

69
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,520
Why are you breathing hard?

70
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,190
Actually, I was here from the beginning,

71
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,030
but made a mad dash to the drama clubto borrow this costume.

72
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,870
You're in a quandary, because you can'tfind your feelings for him.

73
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,950
Right?

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,080
Yes.

75
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,330
Then this great detective will findthat lost property called "love"

76
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,920
and return it to you.

77
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,380
So, imagine him flirting with another girl.

78
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,010
What is this?

79
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,260
Just try to imagine it.

80
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,430
Gloomy.

81
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,430
GLOOMY...

82
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,440
Grrr.

83
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,310
GRRR GRRR

84
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,190
I didn't like that feeling.

85
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,440
Right?

86
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,650
In other words, that's jealousy.

87
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,610
You don't like that imagebecause you like him.

88
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,200
The more unpleasant the feeling,the deeper the love!

89
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,080
Love?

90
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,250
So, you also like him, Miss Kashiwagi.

91
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,330
No, there's no way.

92
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,590
I don't feel that way about the president,right? I mean, come on.

93
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,590
You should take that feelingand nurture it.

94
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,130
I see.

95
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,180
I suspected myself of being a cold personfor not being able to fall in love with someone

96
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,050
who went as far as professinghis love for me.

97
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,890
But...

98
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,640
you're right! I actually do love him!

99
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,600
It's like she was talked into it!

100
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:24,730
What should I doto talk to him more naturally?

101
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,730
I have to givemore appropriate advice, too!

102
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,360
Good question.

103
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,650
Cognitive balance.

104
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,240
You can probably usethe Romeo and Juliet effect.

105
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,370
- Romeo and Juliet?- Romeo and Juliet?

106
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,120
Romeo and Juliet's love faced obstacles.

107
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,620
The idea is that love deepens

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,630
when a couple sharesa powerful enemy they face.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,760
A powerful enemy?

110
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,130
It doesn't have to be a person.

111
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,760
A shared imaginary enemy is fine.

112
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
We don't have an enemy like that.

113
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,180
Oh no! Everyone hasa powerful enemy they have to face!

114
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,520
Wh-Who?

115
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,520
It's...

116
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,400
this society!

117
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,270
Society?

118
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,360
Unending war! The ever-expanding gapbetween rich and poor!

119
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,860
There are no enemiesmore powerful than that!

120
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,950
Wait. It should be something minorlike entrance exams or everyday troubles.

121
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,370
I-I see! So the two of usshould rebel against this corrupt society!

122
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,910
That's a large-scale challenge!

123
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,120
Understood!The two of us will prepare!

124
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,040
Good luck!

125
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,920
Wait! Hold on!

126
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,800
Will it be okay? Did we just createtwo antisocial deviants?

127
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,800
It'll be fine!

128
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,810
Please donate to the fund!

129
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,940
Please!

130
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,230
Please donate to the fund!

131
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,070
It seems they were bothalready interested in charity work.

132
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,400
Please!

133
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,820
This has become a good opportunity.

134
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,110
The feeling of wishing for peace...

135
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,540
That may be the true meaningof rebelling against society.

136
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,790
What are you talking about?

137
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,040
So, her boyfriend is the onewho went to the president for advice.

138
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,380
President?

139
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,300
Shinomiya!

140
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,430
Why are you here with them?

141
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,890
Oh, I applied to dooff-campus fundraising activities.

142
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,440
Please donate to the fund!

143
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,310
Well, when I saw those two who don't seemto be doing it on a whim or as a pastime,

144
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,570
Please!

145
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,020
who are inexperienced but eager...

146
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,440
Please donate to the fund!

147
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,950
it made me feel like supporting themeven if it's not much.

148
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,950
Please!

149
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,700
Jeez.

150
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,450
Please donate to the fund!

151
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,370
This kind of activityreally isn't up my alley, though.

152
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,450
Please!

153
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,210
This is one of the things.

154
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,960
RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:

155
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,500
Results of today's match...

156
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,960
KAGUYA LOSES

157
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,960
Kaguya loses.

158
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,960
PLEASE DONATE TO THE FUND

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,960
PLEASE

160
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,800
MIYUKI SHIROGANEWANTS TO SHOW OFF

161
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,730
WHACK

162
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,150
I was so close!

163
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,690
Not athletic!

164
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,690
NOTE: NOT ATHLETIC

165
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,160
When it comes to studying,Shirogane excels,

166
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,950
but as for athletics, he's a catastrophe,unfit for any human to see.

167
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,870
He delivered newspapers for many years,and in the summertime, worked as a mover.

168
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,460
He's easily able to ride his bikethe 15 kilometers to school every day.

169
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,130
Miyuki Shirogane definitely doesn't sufferfrom a lack of physical ability.

170
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,090
He just has an alarming lackof coordination! That's the cause!

171
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,260
So, in order to protecthis social status at Shuchiin Academy,

172
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,100
daily extraordinary training is essential!

173
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,690
We've got volleyball next week.

174
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,320
I have to get to the pointof average ability by then.

175
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,320
At this rate...

176
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,240
Please take this seriously.

177
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
It looks like a dying alpaca,but is that the president?

178
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,820
Really?

179
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
That dying alpaca?

180
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,870
How cute.

181
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,040
No!

182
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,670
Why isn't this working?

183
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,420
President, are you okay?

184
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,920
Yeah, no prob...

185
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,550
Fujiwara!

186
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,630
What are you doing?

187
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,510
I forgot this here. Um...

188
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,890
Did she see me?

189
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,230
It's over.Good at both sports and studies...

190
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,150
The well-roundedPresident Shirogane brand...

191
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,320
Even though I didn't do anything wrong,my flawless image will...

192
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,280
Did I study for the test? Not really.

193
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,910
This is really bad.

194
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,620
Playing with a ball is so much fun!

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,870
Oh, well.

196
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,370
Whatever she thinks about me,it won't do much damage.

197
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,880
Volleyball is the next sport for P.E., right?

198
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,960
I was able to reserve the gym,so I've been practicing.

199
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,220
My serve is kind of weak, you know?

200
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,880
Oh, I see.

201
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,680
Want me to teach you?

202
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,640
Look, you can't teach someoneunless you can do it yourself.

203
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,390
I'm okay at volleyball!

204
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,520
See?

205
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,770
Right?

206
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,190
Incredible!

207
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,530
PRESIDENT'S CRITERIA

208
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,530
How could her serve be so polished?

209
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,030
How'd you like that?

210
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,320
I-I had no idea you possessedsuch a special skill!

211
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,580
I bet if I taught you,you'd improve in no time.

212
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:35,880
GRIN GRIN

213
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,460
President! When you'reasking someone for help,

214
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,130
what kind of attitude is appropriate?

215
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,220
P-Please teach me.

216
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,470
Sure! No problem!

217
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,010
Okay, first let me seeexactly what the problem is.

218
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,770
Please show me your serve several times.

219
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,180
Okay.

220
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,490
Why does that happen?

221
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,700
I don't know myself.

222
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,490
No matter how many times I try,I keep hitting myself in the head.

223
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,460
And if I'm careful about my head,my timing is totally off.

224
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,500
I'm perfectly deadlocked!

225
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,170
Right.

226
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,800
First of all, when you hit the ball,keep your eyes open!

227
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,880
You don't have to state the obvious.

228
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,680
Right, right!

229
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,680
Then open your eyes wideand try to hit the ball.

230
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,310
As if that would make a difference.

231
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,400
See? That didn't work.

232
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,650
Your eyes aren't open!

233
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,400
They're not open!

234
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,280
How can you project the feeling,"I did what you said, but it didn't work"?

235
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,620
Look! They weren't even openone millimeter!

236
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,280
I don't believe it!

237
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,410
Maybe I have what they call "the yips"?

238
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,540
What arrogance!

239
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,290
President, maybe your image of yourselfisn't in sync with your actual movements!

240
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,550
Let's start with jumpingwith your eyes open!

241
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,590
I'm going to be merciless with you,so be prepared!

242
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,430
Please!

243
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,890
OGRE

244
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,470
And so...

245
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,140
1, 2,

246
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,930
3, 4 ,5...

247
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,060
556, 557, 558, 559...

248
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,150
984, 985, 986 ,987...

249
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,150
No closed eyes when you jump.The ball is your friend.

250
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:22,400
And so, with morning and eveningtraining sessions, three days passed.

251
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,860
President...

252
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,120
Maybe this is enough.

253
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,870
I think you're good enough to beat the level of a person who just sucks at it.

254
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,750
Compared to when you were a creature,you've made a lot of progress.

255
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,710
Not yet!

256
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,750
I can still...

257
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,340
do more!

258
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,630
Why are you working so hard for this?

259
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,130
Because I don't want themto see me look like a dork.

260
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,890
If they're going to see me,I want them to see me look cool!

261
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,980
Are you talkingabout the person you like, President?

262
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,570
Not at all!You've got romance on the brain!

263
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,030
You don't have to hide it from me!

264
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,990
Who's she? Who's she?

265
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,740
Shut up!

266
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,240
Please tell me!

267
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,570
Don't pester me about that!

268
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,460
Y-You did it!

269
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,340
You did it! You did it!

270
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,960
Yeah, Fujiwara. Thanks to you.

271
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,890
It was so tough!But you persevered until you achieved it!

272
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,300
All right, Fujiwara.

273
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,470
Next teach me how to toss and receive!

274
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,900
ONE WEEK LATER

275
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,030
Wow!

276
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,110
Shirogane!

277
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,920
Miss Fujiwara?

278
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,710
I raised that boy.

279
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,710
You're his mother?

280
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,970
RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:

281
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,710
Results of today's match...

282
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,340
Shirogane and Fujiwara's victory!

283
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,970
SHIROGANE ANDFUJIWARA'S VICTORY

284
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,720
YES, WELL...

285
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,970
I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

286
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,350
KAGUYA WANTS TO BE COVERED

287
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,350
All right. Ishigami finished dealingwith the aftermath of that last mixer...

288
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,360
so there really isn't anythingfor us to do today.

289
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,900
Shall we take the day off?

290
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,360
Sure! Then you'd better callfor an early pickup, Miss Kaguya.

291
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,860
Actually...

292
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,370
the car has a flat or something,so I thought I'd walk home.

293
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,040
You won't be kidnapped?

294
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,960
Not much evidence is left on a rainy day,so that's when they target you!

295
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,170
Please don't say thingsthat'll make me nervous.

296
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,960
I'd like to give you a lift,but I have somewhere to go.

297
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,180
Shinomiya is going to walk home?

298
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,180
That's okay.I appreciate the sentiment.

299
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,430
Then maybe that'll work?

300
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,100
The turning point of the season.The rainy season.

301
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,810
Sharing an umbrella!

302
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,940
Two shoulders close togetherunder one umbrella,

303
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,940
an event that immediately closesthe distance between man and woman.

304
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,690
The rainy season is the ideal seasonto share an umbrella.

305
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,440
What nonsense.

306
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,700
Shamefully jostling each otherunder one umbrella...

307
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,990
But I do recognize the meaningbehind sharing an umbrella.

308
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,330
In the realm of romance,what should be feared the most

309
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,210
is summer vacation magic.

310
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,580
"Spending summer vacationwith your sweetheart."

311
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,710
That brand is so sought after

312
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,170
that before summer vacation starts,evaluation of the opposite sex

313
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,720
takes place everywherethroughout the school.

314
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,560
Sharing an umbrella emphasizes to onlookersan intimacy with a member of the opposite sex,

315
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,680
DAMN

316
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,730
MARKING COMPLETE!!

317
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,060
HE'S TAKEN

318
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,980
and is the most efficient wayto mark someone as being excluded

319
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,440
from the groupof "summer sweetheart candidates."

320
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,230
It's really coming down.

321
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,360
Yes. It wasn't raining at all this morning.

322
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,950
There's pretty much one waythat sharing an umbrella works.

323
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,540
One... "A" has forgotten to bringan umbrella and is just standing there.

324
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,460
Two... Unable to ignore that,"B" asks, "Wanna share?"

325
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,460
WANNA SHARE?

326
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,460
SUCCESS!!

327
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,590
Well, should we go?

328
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,540
In short, the successof sharing an umbrella...

329
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,540
Yes.

330
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,960
depends on the "I forgot my umbrella" appeal!

331
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,590
However...

332
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,300
What should I do?I don't have an umbrella.

333
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,300
Shoot, I forgot my umbrella.

334
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,970
COMPETITION BATTING!!

335
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,970
Batting!

336
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,140
An umbrella sharing event beginswith one person forgetting their umbrella.

337
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,730
But if they both forget their umbrellas,there are no developments!

338
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,610
It's just two peoplewho have forgotten to bring an umbrella!

339
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,820
Y-You forgot your umbrella, too, Shinomiya?

340
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,700
Yes. It just slipped my mind,since I usually get picked up.

341
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,030
Why did you forget?

342
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,660
Well, I didn't check the weather forecast.

343
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,080
I didn't thinkwe were in for a storm like this.

344
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,380
Of course, it's all a bluff!

345
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,250
They both have folding umbrellasin their bags!

346
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,300
What do I do?Tell her I have an umbrella now?

347
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,140
But if I do that...

348
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,470
Oh, my.

349
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,640
You wanted to get under my umbrellaso badly that you lied about your umbrella?

350
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,640
Good grief.

351
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,690
How cute.

352
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,440
I can't!

353
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,150
Already, taking out the umbrellawould expose a meaningful lie.

354
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,320
And that would also directly link to invitingthe other person to share the umbrella.

355
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,780
That would clearly spell defeat.

356
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,740
Wait. If she doesn't have a ride,

357
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,250
I'm sure someone from the Shinomiya housewould've given her an umbrella.

358
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,170
It wouldn't matterthat it slipped her mind!

359
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,380
I've got your number, President.

360
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,300
You have an umbrellain that bag, don't you?

361
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,670
You're lying because you're too embarrassedto invite me under your umbrella.

362
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,930
In this situation,the condition for victory...

363
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,180
is none other than exposingthe other person's lie!

364
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,850
Hey, Shinomiya,maybe you've actually got one.

365
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,690
Shirogane made the first move.

366
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,690
Your usual ride had a flat today,on the day it rains.

367
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,690
But today of all days, someone like you,who always plans ahead, forgot her umbrella.

368
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,200
How likely is that?

369
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,870
What are you trying to say?

370
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,200
Oh, nothing.

371
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,000
Not enough information.

372
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,210
Should I gamble on a game-winning hit?

373
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,210
If we're talking planning ahead,you do the same, President.

374
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,290
What?

375
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,510
Before, you said you didn't checkthe weather forecast, but I find that odd.

376
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,260
What's odd about it?

377
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,720
I have days like that.

378
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,600
You always ride your bicycleto school, don't you?

379
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,480
Yes, but...

380
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,230
Then,

381
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,230
why did you take the train today?

382
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,490
I noticed your bikewasn't in the bike rack today.

383
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
What?

384
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,990
I mean, if you think about it,there's nothing unnatural at all.

385
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,500
On a rainy day,you take the train to school.

386
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,330
That's the reasonable thing to do, isn't it?

387
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,790
Say, President...

388
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,380
you said you missedthe weather forecast, right?

389
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,420
Then why did you chooseto take the train today, of all days?

390
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,430
The truth is...

391
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,430
you saw it, didn't you?

392
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,970
The weather forecast.

393
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,980
The difference in preparation!

394
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,150
Maybe you just thoughtyou forgot to bring an umbrella.

395
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,530
President, would you take a lookin your bag to see if it's there?

396
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,990
The difference in advance preparationwill decide the outcome of the game!

397
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,740
It didn't even take Shirogane an hourto devise his umbrella-sharing plan.

398
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,250
On the other hand,Kaguya confirmed the weather report.

399
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,870
She carefully looked at the weather map,

400
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,750
used an awl to piercethe tire of her ride,

401
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,630
and checked the bicycle rack.

402
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,000
The amount of advance preparationgave her a big lead.

403
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,630
Naturally, she predictedthis situation, as well.

404
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,130
Now I'll score a point for good measure!

405
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,760
I guess I'll just get soakedwalking home in the rain.

406
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,890
GRIN

407
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,390
Miss Kaguya, you forgot your umbrella?

408
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,400
I've got a spare in the classroom,so please use this one.

409
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,320
Please be more careful for next time!

410
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,280
Absent-minded Miss Kaguya!

411
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,410
Well, see ya tomorrow!

412
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,880
I had him! I was one step away!

413
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,500
Why does that girl always spoil it?

414
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,920
Now that it's come to this...

415
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,220
Here.

416
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,260
I'm giving you this umbrella, President!

417
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,680
Do what you want with it! Here!

418
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,060
No, that umbrella belongs to Fujiwara.

419
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,430
I'm subletting it!

420
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,440
No, look...

421
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,440
All right.

422
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,700
How about I borrow half of it?

423
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,460
I suppose that will do.

424
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,480
Results of today's match...

425
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,480
RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:

426
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,020
A tie.

427
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,480
A TIE
