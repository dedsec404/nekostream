1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,270
CONFESSION

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,430
CONFESSION

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,730
You fall in love with someone...

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,020
P-Please be my girlfriend!

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,480
confess that love...

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,110
and become a couple.

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,120
Everyone would say that's a wonderful thing.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,040
But they're wrong!

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,960
Even among sweethearts,there exists a distinct power relationship!

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,420
A side that exploitsand a side that's exploited,

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,590
a side that's devoted,a side receiving devotion,

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,510
a winner and a loser!

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,020
If you're trying to live a noble life,then you mustn't become a loser!

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,640
Love is war!

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,270
CONFESSION

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,520
CONFESSION

17
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,820
The person who falls in love loses!

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,030
KAGUYA-SAMA: LOVE IS WAR

19
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,620
Shuchiin Academy!

20
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,380
It's a prestigious schoolwith an ancient and honorable origin,

21
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,630
founded as a facilityto educate upper-crust children.

22
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,550
The focus on the nobility is gone,

23
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,930
but many talented studentsborn into wealthy, distinguished families,

24
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,010
and shouldering the futureattend the school.

25
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,350
And now a messagefrom the student council.

26
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,020
The student council members.

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,730
Naturally ordinary people wouldn't be permittedto lead and bring these students together!

28
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,490
Kaguya Shinomiya, the vice-presidentof the student council at Shuchiin Academy.

29
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,160
Total assets: 200 trillion yen.

30
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,700
Her family owns the Shinomiya Group,

31
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,580
one of the top four financial conglomeratesin Japan, with over 1,000 subsidiaries.

32
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,870
SHINOMIYA BANK

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,540
Befitting her superior lineage,she's a talented young woman

34
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,000
who has attainedsplendid achievements in various fields,

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,710
such as traditional performing arts,music and martial arts.

36
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,510
That is Kaguya Shinomiya.

37
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,470
And the young man Shinomiya supports is...

38
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,600
Miyuki Shirogane, the presidentof the student council at Shuchiin Academy.

39
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,020
He's wise and intelligent,strong and silent.

40
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,730
He scores first placein the practice exams!

41
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,110
In contrast to talented Kaguya,

42
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,610
his devotion to studyingcommands awe and fear,

43
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,940
and because of that exemplary behavior,

44
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:44,370
PRESIDENT OF STUDENT COUNCIL

45
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,110
he was selected to bethe student council president,

46
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,740
despite being relatively new to the school.

47
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,700
The weight of a solid gold braided cordhas been passed down

48
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,580
from president to presidentat Shuchiin Academy for 200 years!

49
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,370
That's all!

50
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,300
They always look so cool!

51
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,640
Yes, when they're together,they seem even more noble and elegant!

52
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,970
I still wonder if they're dating.

53
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,640
What? I'd be shocked if they were!

54
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,110
I always wonder what they talk aboutin the student council room.

55
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:19,780
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM

56
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,530
P-President!

57
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,360
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

58
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,240
You finally bought a smartphone?

59
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,030
KAGUYA WANTS TO TRADE

60
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:31,790
GLITTER

61
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,370
It's got Line, too.

62
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,990
Then let's exchange ID's!

63
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,790
It's the age of I.T.!

64
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,790
Cheap cell phone! It's got a cheap SIM card!

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,120
Even Shirogane, a stubborn cheapskate

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,040
who's long insistedthat smartphones are unnecessary,

67
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,540
- Trendy! Trendy!- I'll send it over to you by Line.

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,170
has finally given in and gotten one.

69
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,170
GLITTER

70
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,130
It doesn't even need to be said how importantsmartphones are for high school life.

71
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,920
Very nice.

72
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,550
I love how you can do so many things with it.

73
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,390
You can use them for social plansor just idly chatting,

74
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,220
but sometimes you may not get a reply,so joy can swing to sorrow.

75
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,060
It's possible to confess love to someoneusing the Line social app.

76
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,560
Yes! This past half-year was wasted,because he wasn't using Line!

77
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,320
All right, ask me for my IDanytime, Shinomiya!

78
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,200
Yay! I got your ID!

79
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,820
Why hasn't she asked me?It's my personal information!

80
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,080
Never mind. Should I just ask her?

81
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,500
But...

82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,120
Asking for contact information,between the lines,

83
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,710
that indicates a degree of desperationand ulterior motive,

84
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,590
which then beget a special meaning...

85
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,090
That meaning is, in fact, love!

86
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,760
In a romantic relationship, "the personwho falls in love loses" is an absolute rule!

87
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,350
Confirming your love for someoneequals defeat!

88
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,350
Asking the opposite sex for their contactinformation is as good as a confession of love!

89
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,400
Apparently, the presidentis in love with the vice-president!

90
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,610
Seriously? I have to share that!

91
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,490
For a boy going through puberty,that means death!

92
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,450
Forget it!

93
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,240
There's no way I can ask her!

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,620
Shinomiya, you ask me!

95
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,290
I'm sure the president is waiting for meto ask him, but he'd better not hold his breath.

96
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,420
It would mean something if he came to meand asked, even though he was embarrassed.

97
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,760
Conflict! It's an inevitability in this world.

98
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,300
Kill or be killed!

99
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
Your contact info...

100
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,050
Ask for it or be asked for it?

101
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,930
It would be no overstatement to say thereinlies the person's superiority or inferiority!

102
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,860
Good grief. How much trouble does he thinkI went to just to make sure he got a phone?

103
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,020
Cheap cell phone!It's got a cheap SIM card!

104
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:21,270
SHINOMIYAHOUSE COOK

105
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:21,270
KAGUYA'S ATTENDANT

106
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,600
- Trendy! Trendy!- I'll send it over to you by Line.

107
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,270
SHINOMIYA HOUSE GARDENER

108
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,610
I can finally contact the presidentoutside of school.

109
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,110
I can say that my plan was a success,by and large.

110
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,120
I see. She wants to make me,the man, ask her!

111
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,160
If that's how she wants to play it...

112
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,630
President, this profile photo...

113
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,670
Yeah, it's a photo of mefrom when I was a kid.

114
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,670
It's cute! You even scowled as a kid!

115
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,760
A photo of the presidentfrom his childhood?

116
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,760
You know how to hurt a guy.

117
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,890
But that photo is a little embarrassing.

118
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,100
I-I'm not especially interested.

119
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,020
I think I'll change it to a different one.

120
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,430
I'll change it in three minutes.

121
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,980
What?

122
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,190
If the president changes his profile picture,I'll never be able to see that photo!

123
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,490
But asking him for his contact info

124
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,530
expresses nothing other than"I want to talk to you anytime"!

125
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,160
It means "I want to sendcasual messages before bedtime"...

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,540
or "I want to talk to you on the phone...

127
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,710
in the wee hoursthe night before a test and chat"!

128
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,710
It'd be like that's what I was thinking!

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,470
A lady must not do anything as improperas asking a male for his contact information!

130
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,090
Since it's come to this,I'll have to use my last resort!

131
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,020
Kaguya?

132
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,820
The president is so cruel.

133
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,690
DRIP

134
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,780
H-How could you be so mean?

135
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,120
Her skill of deception has been activated!

136
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,160
A MAIDEN’S TEARS

137
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,490
ACTIVATED

138
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,490
You're terrible, President!

139
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,540
You're terrible!

140
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,830
Her words don't especially mean anything.

141
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,960
But being told he's mean makes himfeel like he's done something mean.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,500
BARNUM EFFECT

143
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,500
In psychology,it's called the "Barnum Effect."

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,510
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to leave you out!

145
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,840
Here, I'll show you too, Shinomiya!

146
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,300
- Wait. You...- Too late!

147
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,010
She memorized it!

148
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,600
Though it was a fleeting glimpse,Shirogane's profile photo

149
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,520
has been preservedin Kaguya's hippocampus!

150
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,520
Shirogane lost the sole ace up his sleeve!

151
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,900
Kaguya made a comebackto win overwhelmingly!

152
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,320
Now, I have no reasonto ask the president for his ID.

153
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,200
Go ahead. Ask me for mine.

154
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,910
Can I... Can I come up with anything else?

155
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,630
Shirogane racked his brainto come from behind!

156
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,380
I guess I'll have to use that!

157
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,460
Kaguya realized that she neededto block that line of thinking!

158
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,340
He's dead.

159
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,590
The conclusion is at hand!

160
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,180
That's right!

161
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,060
It's cruel to talk about using Line whenKaguya's old phone doesn't support that app!

162
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,190
I'm sorry!

163
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,940
- It can't use it?- It can't use it?

164
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,020
You're rich! Buy a different phone!

165
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,980
I've used this phone ever since kindergarten,so I'm attached to it!

166
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,320
I can't switch it now!

167
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,950
RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH

168
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,900
Get rid of your weird hang-up!

169
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,950
This is a story of love and intellectgoing around in circles.

170
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,530
How is it weird?

171
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,950
BOTH LOSE

172
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,950
- I don't know if it's weird.- You're weird, President!

173
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,950
THEY HAVE EXCHANGED ADDRESSES.

174
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,460
It's cold today.

175
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,880
I wish summer would get here soon.

176
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,790
CHIKA WANTSTO GO SOMEWHERE

177
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,210
Talk about impatient.It'll be spring for a long time yet.

178
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,220
Oh no! Time flies by way too fast!

179
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,140
If you're careless, you'll graduatewith nothing happening at all!

180
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,470
80 DAMAGE TO THE HEARTSOF SHINOMIYA AND SHIROGANE

181
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,100
Over the summer,let's go on a student council trip!

182
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,310
That's a good idea.

183
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,810
Let's go somewherelike an informal social gathering.

184
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,060
Yay!

185
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,400
A trip, huh?

186
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,480
Then the mountains would be good.

187
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,650
Fresh air.

188
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,820
Reverberating echoes.

189
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,370
SUMMIT

190
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,120
We'll rent a cottage and have a barbecue.

191
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,630
At night, the starry sky will put a spell on us.

192
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,130
Look. There's Deneb, Altair and Vega,the Summer Triangle.

193
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,140
Altair and Vega representthe story of Hikoboshi and Orihime.

194
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,430
They're just like us.

195
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,140
Close together...

196
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,650
but so far apart.

197
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,700
VEGA

198
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,370
DENEB

199
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,370
ALTAIR

200
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,160
No! President, I want to be Bbto your Alpha Centauri B!

201
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,200
Please let me revolvearound you, President!

202
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,750
Oh, boy.

203
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,250
You're a pampered first-magnitude star.

204
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,000
BOOM

205
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,000
That's it!

206
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,010
It has to be the mountains!

207
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,800
Yes. If we're going, then—

208
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,340
It has to be the sea.

209
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,390
Wha—

210
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,970
The sea versus the mountains!

211
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,270
The polar opposites that peoplehave been fighting over since ancient times.

212
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,400
The curtain riseson human nature's battle of thoughts.

213
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,610
The sea. The sea is the origin of life.

214
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,610
As the sun sets there, I'm sure humansreturn to being creatures of instinct.

215
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,160
My swimsuit will bewitch the presidentthe second he sees it!

216
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,250
The sea will cast its spellon the president,

217
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,920
and he'll confess his love to mewhile the sun sets.

218
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,260
Perfect.

219
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,430
The roar of the seais the best lullaby in the world.

220
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,140
And the salty sea breezewill blow away the summer heat.

221
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,930
The sea?

222
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,890
The sea is the last place I'll go!

223
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,100
I can't swim!

224
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,140
NOTE: SINKS LIKE A HAMMER

225
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,270
If I went into the waterwith a swimming ring...

226
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,730
I didn't know you werea hopeless swimmer, President.

227
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,320
How cute.

228
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,450
No way! It has to be the mountains!

229
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,780
I refuse to go to the sea!

230
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,200
The beach would be too crowded.

231
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,790
I hate bumping elbows with strangers.

232
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,500
Let's use a private beachowned by my family.

233
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,040
It has warm showers, too.

234
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,130
Sunburn is a young lady's archenemy!

235
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,840
I'll bring along the highest grade sunscreen.

236
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,880
And to seal the deal, I'll hirea first-class aesthetician for skin aftercare.

237
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,220
- There might be sharks.- I'll hire a first-class hunter from Florida.

238
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,810
Then we can have shark fin soup.

239
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,810
COMFY

240
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,980
Damn you, rich girl!

241
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,560
Weak sauce, President.

242
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:42,570
THINGS THE PRESIDENT IS LIKELY TO SAY,VOL. 42, TRIP EDITION

243
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,190
I've already turned out a series of manualsto prepare for when you oppose me.

244
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,570
However you attack me,I can render it harmless.

245
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,820
We can only go to the seain the summer, right?

246
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,030
With mountains,you can't depend on weather.

247
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,370
It rains a lot.

248
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,950
Besides, it's got a lot of bugs.

249
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,540
Bugs!

250
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:59,420
Moths, mosquitoes, horseflies, centipedes,ladybugs, earthworms, drone beetles...

251
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,170
Bugs are the only thing.

252
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,880
Bugs are the only thing I can't stand!

253
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,800
NOTE: HATES BUGS

254
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,550
What should I do?If I go to the sea, I can't swim.

255
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,430
If I go to the mountains,there are insects!

256
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,560
Guess I'll buy a swimsuit.

257
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,730
I won!

258
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,190
That's right.

259
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,270
My swimsuit from last yeardoesn't fit me now.

260
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,690
I have to buy a new one.

261
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,620
FLAT

262
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,120
Normally, Shinomiyahas confidence in her body line.

263
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,960
But take that away,and her offensive ability becomes fragile...

264
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,460
Pop.

265
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,090
on the level of a peashooter.

266
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,300
On the other hand, Chika Fujiwara'soffensive ability is tank-class.

267
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
The differencein military strength is hopeless.

268
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,760
This is bad!Never mind about enchanting him!

269
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
What is that?

270
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,270
Compared to that, Shinomiya is...How can I put it?

271
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,270
She has a cute chest?

272
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,280
Cute?

273
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,030
Let's go to the mountains.

274
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,030
The beach is too crowded,and there are sharks.

275
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,290
- Let's go to the mountains.- You didn't say that before!

276
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,540
No, the sea!

277
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,460
It rains in the mountains, and there arelots of bugs! Let's go to the sea!

278
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,290
You, too?

279
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,830
- The mountains.- The sea.

280
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,670
- Mountains.- Sea.

281
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,590
- Mountains.- Sea.

282
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,420
- Mountains.- Sea.

283
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,210
Since it's come to this,have Chika Fujiwara decide!

284
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,550
Me?

285
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,760
Yes, let's do it that way.

286
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,300
The sea. Got it?

287
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,930
The mountains!You wouldn't betray me, would you?

288
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,430
U-Um...

289
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,730
If I have to choose one...

290
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,020
The mountains?

291
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,020
Yes!

292
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,730
But I specifically want to go...

293
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,200
to Mount Osore!

294
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,320
Mount Osore?

295
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,450
Children's Limbo and Blood Pond.

296
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,960
There are pinwheelssymbolizing death and rebirth.

297
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,460
And as long as we're there,let's have a medium channel a spirit.

298
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,210
Who would be good?

299
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,170
Christ? Buddha?

300
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,260
Well, I guess we can think about itwhen summer comes.

301
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,260
Prince Shotoku could be good, too.

302
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:14,140
Aristotle, Shakespeare, Cleopatra,Einstein, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Gandhi,

303
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,470
I agree.

304
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,970
Today's match...

305
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,390
Ruined.

306
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,980
Sen no Rikyu, Caesar, Marie Antoinette,Oscar Francois de Jarjayes!

307
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,980
BECAUSE CHIKA FUJIWARAIS A LITTLE SCARY

308
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,940
CHIKA FUJIWARA

309
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,440
Romantic advice?

310
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,400
Yes! Where romance is concerned,

311
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,820
I thought a veteran like you...

312
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,070
could give me advice, President!

313
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,030
MIYUKI WANTS TO HIDEHIS IGNORANCE

314
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,200
I see.

315
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,290
I'll help you somehow.

316
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,250
President!

317
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,290
A romantic veteran?

318
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,880
How did people get that image of me?

319
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,130
Miyuki Shirogane, 17 years old.Dating experience...

320
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,590
None.

321
00:15:51,930 --> 00:16:03,480
NOTE: VIRGIN

322
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,890
What? If this advice exposes me...

323
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,930
The president is a virgin.

324
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,390
A virgin?

325
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,350
I'm so disillusioned!

326
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,480
Sh-Shinomiya!

327
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,820
How cute.

328
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,570
No! I have to get through this!

329
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,860
If it's about love, leave it to me!

330
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,530
I've never been rejected before!

331
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,080
That's why you're the president.

332
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,700
He's never confessed his love,so that's not actually a lie.

333
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,460
The president is giving advice about love?

334
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,790
This could be my chanceto hear his views on love!

335
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,170
So, what's the problem?

336
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:36,510
KASHIWAGI

337
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,550
I have a classmate, Kashiwagi.

338
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,510
I want to confess my love to her!

339
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,430
Oh!

340
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,180
But when I imagine her rejecting me,

341
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,810
I think maybe I shouldbecome friends with her first.

342
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,400
Incidentally,have you talked to her before?

343
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,280
She gave me chocolateon Valentine's Day!

344
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,110
What kind of chocolate?

345
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,660
Choco Balls. Three pieces.

346
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,030
Is that obligatory gift chocolate?

347
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,040
Obligatory gift chocolate at best!

348
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah, I would say...

349
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,920
she's definitely in love with you!

350
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,670
Why?

351
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,300
He got Choco Balls!

352
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,510
Listen!

353
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,050
Women are creatureswho aren't upfront about their feelings!

354
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,930
Think of it as behavingthe exact opposite of how they feel!

355
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,180
The Choco Balls seemlike a throwaway, but...

356
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,180
GASP

357
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,060
It means she likes me?

358
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,180
What about opposites?

359
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,640
All right! That soundedlike half-decent advice!

360
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,400
But I don't thinkshe does feel that way about me.

361
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,270
Just the other day...

362
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,780
Hey, do you have a girlfriend?

363
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,620
No, but...

364
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,530
I knew it!

365
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,330
He said he doesn't have a girlfriend!

366
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,410
BOOM

367
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,620
He doesn't look like he has one!

368
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,660
That's hilarious!

369
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,380
So, I think she was just making fun of me.

370
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,170
It's unfortunate,but she was making fun of him.

371
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,590
The issue is whether she even sees himas a member of the opposite sex.

372
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,930
You're in your popular phase right now.

373
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,730
Why are you so suspicious of women?

374
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,400
Woman are humans, just like you!

375
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,940
That's not what you were saying before!

376
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,690
I'll make that situationeasier to understand!

377
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,070
Hey, do you have a girlfriend?

378
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,320
If you don't, I wanna go out with you.

379
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,410
No, but...

380
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,620
I knew it!

381
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,370
You and I are connectedby the string of fate!

382
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,830
He said he doesn't have a girlfriend!

383
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,500
BOOM

384
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,120
He doesn't look like he has one!

385
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,500
THUMP-THUMP

386
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,000
After all, he's too high-class!

387
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,000
BOOM

388
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,460
That's hilarious!

389
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,000
THUMP-THUMP

390
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,210
I'm thrilled that he's available!

391
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,220
BOOM

392
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,220
THUMP-THUMP

393
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,220
I'm the one who's most worthy of him.

394
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,470
Isn't that thinking too positively?

395
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,930
It can't be!

396
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,390
Exactly!

397
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,810
I have to choose only one of them?

398
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,850
You're an idiot, too?

399
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,070
Won't that cause a riftin their friendship with each other?

400
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,280
Worst case, it could lead to bullying.

401
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,200
That's what female friendship is like.

402
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,070
What is this arrogant conversation?

403
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,830
But it'll be okay.Because she'll have you.

404
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,250
All you have to do is protect her.

405
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,330
I can... protect her?

406
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,550
- President!- Yes.

407
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,590
What is this?

408
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,340
This'll be my first timeconfessing my love to someone.

409
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,130
How should I go about it?

410
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,970
I have a good idea.

411
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,850
- Imagine the girl in question is right here.- Okay.

412
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,850
You do...

413
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,020
this!

414
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,230
Go out with me.

415
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,740
When you suddenly corner a girlagainst the wall like that, she'll be nervous,

416
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,870
but the momentyou whisper of love in her ear,

417
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,120
anxiety will turn into a throbbing heart.Your chance of success will go up!

418
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,580
He startled me!

419
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,750
I call this technique "wall-down."

420
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,880
I came up with it myself.

421
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,130
It's "wall-slamming”!It's been around for years!

422
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,510
SHIVER SHIVER

423
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,050
Genius.

424
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,510
You're that stupid?

425
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,260
Thank you!You've given me courage, President!

426
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,520
I knew the person who conqueredShinomiya could help me!

427
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,650
No, Shinomiya and I aren't dating.

428
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,770
Th-That's right!No one's ever conquered me!

429
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,280
Really?

430
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,030
It seems like you two are a couple.

431
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,660
No, just the opposite.

432
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,530
Recently, I wonder if she hates me.

433
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,160
I don't even think she's interested in me.

434
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,500
I don't especially hate you.

435
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,290
Did I do something to give you that idea?

436
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,540
She has no self-awareness.

437
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,760
President!What's important is how you feel!

438
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,140
How do I feel about Shinomiya?

439
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,850
Well, to be honest, her wealthand natural talents annoy me.

440
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,690
She's ditsier than you'd think,scary in private, and her chest...

441
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,280
But maybe those are all good points!

442
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,030
She's actually cute! A beauty!

443
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,950
Refined, elegant and clever, too!Really, she's too perfect!

444
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,120
Yeah, Shinomiya is the ideal woman!

445
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,000
That was close! She's right there!

446
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,210
Thank God I noticed!

447
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,340
Anyway, nothing will happenunless you tell her how you feel!

448
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,850
And nothing good can comeof carrying out some weird scheme!

449
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,680
Huh? Why do these words resonate with me?

450
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,190
I-I'll do my best!

451
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,980
Thank you so much!

452
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,160
Kaguya.

453
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,120
Has something good happened?

454
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,580
No, nothing.

455
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,920
Afterwards...

456
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,710
he confessed his feelings to Kashiwagi,

457
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,170
and somehowthey're apparently a couple now.

458
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,390
President, I poured you some tea.

459
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,180
Oh, thanks.

460
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,480
Thankfully, she seems to bein a good mood.

461
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,190
Today's match...

462
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,770
Is that your one smileof the day?

463
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,440
Kaguya wasn't particularly at fault...

464
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,360
No, I'm like thisall the time.

465
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,320
when Shirogane put her in a foul mood,then a good mood,

466
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,320
Oh.

467
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,950
but he largely wasted his efforts,resulting in a loss for himself.

468
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,950
THE NEXT PERSON SEEKING ADVICE

469
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,950
Shock!
