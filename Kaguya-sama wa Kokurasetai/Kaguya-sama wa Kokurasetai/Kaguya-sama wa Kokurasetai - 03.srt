1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,640
You fall in love with someone...

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,980
FATE

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,980
confess that love...

4
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,980
DESTINY

5
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,480
and become a couple.

6
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,360
Everyone would say that's a wonderful thing.

7
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,900
But they're wrong!

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,620
Love is war!

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,240
CONFESSION

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,490
CONFESSION

11
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,040
The person who falls in love loses!

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,000
KAGUYA-SAMA: LOVE IS WAR

13
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,010
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM

14
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,010
Oh.

15
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,510
TEENS LOVE BIBLE

16
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,510
What's this?

17
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,520
Oh, the headmaster confiscated itfrom a student.

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,980
MIYUKI SHIROGANESTILL HASN'T DONE IT

19
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,270
He said, "It's not proper reading material,so dispose of it."

20
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,360
Jeez. Why didn't he just do it himself?

21
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,860
Not proper reading material?

22
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,950
CRUDE

23
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,950
Crude!

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,950
I mean lewd!

25
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,280
LEWD

26
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,120
This country is becoming lewd!

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,160
What's got her skirt in a bunch?

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,410
Maybe nudity with pubic hair?

29
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,290
Shirogane showed great interest.

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,790
- Kaguya, I wouldn't if I were you!- Let's see.

31
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,260
A survey. "When was your 'first time?'"

32
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,800
"By high school. 34%."

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,050
No way! There's no waythat many are doing it!

34
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,680
34%!

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,970
In other words, more than a third!

36
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,690
One out of three peoplemeans there's a high likelihood

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,690
DID IT

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,690
DID IT

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,690
DID IT

40
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,440
that one of these threehave already had such an experience!

41
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,150
I-It's only that highbecause the respondents

42
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,240
are the people who readthis kind of magazine, right?

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,450
Oh, you mean "sample selection bias."

44
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,580
Yes, there can't actually bethat many people.

45
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,790
Right?

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Really?

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,750
This percentage seems about right to me.

48
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,210
In fact, it's probably low.

49
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,960
Um, I don't even think I need to ask,

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,470
but have you hadthat kind of experience, Kaguya?

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,220
Yes, the first was a long time ago.

52
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,600
TOWN PAGES

53
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,600
Huh. The area code for Aomori is 017.That's surprising.

54
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,270
Isn't that normalfor most high school students?

55
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,940
You two must not have been raisedin a loving environment.

56
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,870
M-Maybe I should hurry upand get a boyfriend.

57
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,870
The area code for Oshamanbein Hokkaido is 01377... and 013...

58
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,700
But I'm sure Father would never allow it.

59
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,870
Kaguya realizes there's a nervouscomponent to their reactions.

60
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,420
When humans realizethey've gotten a late start

61
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,250
compared to those around them,they get nervous.

62
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,550
Then that anxiety makes themsuccumb to the emotional need

63
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,630
of finding a romantic partner. In short...

64
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,640
I'm too late to the party?

65
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Iâ€™M FALLING BEHIND?

66
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
I HAVE TO GET A GIRLFRIEND!

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,930
SHINOMIYA, GO OUT WITH ME!

68
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,230
Shinomiya, go out with me!

69
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,650
Confess your love!

70
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,110
Kaguya's objective of the day was decided.

71
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,030
The whole thing is ridiculous!

72
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,570
Oh, President,I heard you were very popular.

73
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,740
She instigates.

74
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,410
Don't you have a girlfriend?

75
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,580
She instigates some more!

76
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,500
No, I don't.

77
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,880
I don't have that kind of relationshipwith a particular person. Not right now.

78
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,210
"Not right now"!

79
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,210
An expression that hintsat the existence of a girlfriend long ago,

80
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,010
but even if he's never gone outwith anyone, it isn't a lie!

81
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,100
It's an expression loved by peoplethe world over, from the young to the elderly!

82
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,600
That's right! Miyuki Shiroganehas never had a romantic experience!

83
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,230
And yet it can't be saidthat he isn't popular.

84
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,480
In fact, he is quite popular.

85
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,490
Perhaps it should be saidbirds of a feather flock together.

86
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,490
Or perhaps we should consider thatin many cases, oddballs are drawn to oddballs.

87
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,450
When the trend is only dangerouscharacters being attracted to you,

88
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,450
WHAT IS THIS HAIR?

89
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,410
you won't reach a romantic relationship.

90
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,410
WHAT IS THIS SMOKE?

91
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,420
Why am I so popular?

92
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,050
And so, despite having no experience,

93
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,970
Shirogane was supremely confidentin his own popularity.

94
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,930
The women must be attractedto my overflowing intelligence.

95
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,930
Should I feel guilty?

96
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,440
Yes, this man possessesboth boundless confidence and pure chastity,

97
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,150
Not right now.

98
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,560
a combination that has made him...

99
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,980
Not right now.

100
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,070
...a twisted monster virgin!

101
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,240
Oh. Then of course you've done it, right?

102
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,240
But even that monster has a weakness.

103
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,080
MONSTER VIRGIN

104
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,080
He is still a virgin.

105
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,500
It would be easy to lie.

106
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,210
But telling an experienced personthat I have experience

107
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,840
would be like a movie neophyte claimingknowledge about movies to a film buff,

108
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,510
thinking they can trick the person!

109
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,010
Supposing I did lie to her...

110
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,430
I have tons of experience!

111
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,640
You're bragging about it?

112
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,430
Are you that embarrassedabout having your virginity exposed?

113
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,020
How cute.

114
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,350
She'd see through me!

115
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,020
I-If you're that curious,you can always ask me directly.

116
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,020
The best he can do is bluff.

117
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,570
Really?

118
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,280
I know you have a little sister, President,

119
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,990
so you probablydo it with her all the time.

120
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,870
Oh, that...

121
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,040
Of course not! Are you a moron?

122
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,880
Well, you're family.

123
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,920
I did it to my newborn nephew.

124
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,050
It was videotaped.

125
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:46,880
You're a loon!

126
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,920
Good times.

127
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,350
It's not good to be excessively afraidof physical contact with other people.

128
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,230
I guess that's the dark sideof modern society.

129
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,480
No, it's you!

130
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,350
You're the dark side of the nobility!

131
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,730
What's so strange?

132
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,400
You must do it a lot to your dog Pesu,don't you, Chika?

133
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,490
- You do?- No! Please don't drag me into this!

134
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,990
The Shinomiya family upbringingis this perverse?

135
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,750
She's so ignorant of the ways of the worldthat she thinks it's common sense?

136
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,540
Shinomiya...

137
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,790
Let me ask you this.

138
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,590
Do you know what it meansby "first time"?

139
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,050
Please don't make light of me.

140
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,970
As a lady, I know that much.

141
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,970
It's referring to kissing.

142
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,020
Honestly.

143
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,110
Kaguya Shinomiya.

144
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,230
As the daughterof the owner of a conglomerate,

145
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,320
she's been protectedfrom sexual information for 16 years now.

146
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,450
The beginning and endof her sexual education was kissing.

147
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,750
ALL ABOUT SEXPISTIL STAMENWHEN YOU GET MARRIED,LEAVE IT TO THE MAN.THE END

148
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,750
Anything more than thatshe picked up from urban legends.

149
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,000
So the storkhas nothing to do with it, right?

150
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,000
She's a "daughter in a box"taken to the extreme!

151
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,130
Naturally, she has no ideawhat "your first time" refers to.

152
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,130
Shinomiya...

153
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,090
President, I'll take this one.

154
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,770
Kaguya...

155
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,270
In this case, "first time" means...

156
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,480
And then...

157
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,820
puts...

158
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,530
in...

159
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,320
After that...

160
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,160
the two...

161
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,530
moving...

162
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,660
like beasts!

163
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,660
MINUTES

164
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,660
LATER

165
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
A-After all...

166
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,630
the law is you do that kind of thingafter you get married!

167
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,840
I thought my heart was gonna stop!

168
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,930
RESULTS OFTODAY'S MATCH:

169
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,930
SHINOMIYA LOSES

170
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,270
Today's match...

171
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,930
FOR INCREDIBLE IGNORANCEABOUT SEXUAL KNOWLEDGE

172
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,930
Shinomiya loses.

173
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,690
President, I disapproveof illicit intercourse.

174
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,320
So would you go do it to yourself?

175
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,970
KAGUYA WANTSTO BE FIGURED OUT

176
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,630
It's a quiet night, isn't it?

177
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,970
Yes.

178
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,180
It's Fujiwara's turn to walk Pesu today,so she had to go home early.

179
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,810
Pesu! Pesu!

180
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,310
And Ishigami was in and out of herebefore I even noticed.

181
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,860
He gets the perfect attendance awardin his own way.

182
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,620
You've mellowed outsince we first started here, Shinomiya.

183
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,240
You mean I've gained weight?

184
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,620
No, "mellow," not "marshmallow."Your personality.

185
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,040
Like making small talk.

186
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,540
Yes.

187
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,170
I've been making an effortto become slightly more likeable.

188
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,170
That's what it is?

189
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,800
Well, it also helps that I have a betterunderstanding of you as a person.

190
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,930
You understand me?

191
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,190
Really?

192
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,110
We've been working together hereat student council for half a year now.

193
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,440
I think I havea pretty good understanding of you.

194
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,780
Then I'll test you.

195
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,820
Test?

196
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,080
Yes, let's test how muchyou really know about me.

197
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,080
Do you know the game "20 Questions"?

198
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,290
20 Questions!

199
00:10:51,290 --> 00:11:00,300
EXAMPLE

200
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,710
It's a game in which one playergets 20 questions

201
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,550
Is it smaller than my palm?

202
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,170
to guess what the other playeris thinking of.

203
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,630
Is it edible?

204
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,300
But the player can only ask questionsthat can be answered with a yes or no.

205
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,300
I'm thinking of an eraser.

206
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,600
If the guesser gets it correctlywithin 20 questions, they win.

207
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,560
If they can't, the other person wins.

208
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,400
But if you get 20 questions,you can pretty much guess it.

209
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,820
If you really know me, though...

210
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,570
you should be able to guess itwith half that, ten questions.

211
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,990
I see.

212
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,990
That's fine.

213
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,040
Are you ready?

214
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,120
Yes.

215
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,460
20 CHAMBER BELGIAN REVOLVER"HENRION, DASSY, AND HEUSCHEN"(BUT ONLY 10 BULLETS LOADED)

216
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,500
Then my first question...

217
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,920
One, is it something that can be touched?

218
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,260
Yes.

219
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,430
It isn't a word or concept.

220
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,550
- Two, is it an electrical appliance?- No.

221
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,430
- Three, is it something that's warm or cold?- Yes.

222
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,520
Considering her answers,it could be a living thing,

223
00:11:53,060 --> 00:12:01,200
WARM-BLOODEDANIMAL

224
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:01,200
FOOD

225
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,320
food, a substancelike warm water or ice,

226
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,200
BOILING WATER

227
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,200
ICE

228
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,200
a bonfire or some kindof temperature control device?

229
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,200
FIRE...

230
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,200
ETC., ETC...

231
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,780
But since this is a testof how well I understand Shinomiya,

232
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,450
the answer must be somethingconnected to Kaguya Shinomiya.

233
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,080
Therefore...

234
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,090
Four, is it something you own?

235
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,420
No.

236
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,550
Five, is it something you touched today?

237
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,590
No.

238
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,260
Six, is it something that's at your house?

239
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,550
No.

240
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,310
Three noes in a row.

241
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,850
I thought it was something Shinomiyapossessed, but now I don't know.

242
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,230
I'll explore Shinomiya's psychologya little more.

243
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,320
All right.

244
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,940
Seven, is it something you like?

245
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,700
Yes.

246
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
What is that expression?

247
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,210
She looks kind of embarrassed or bashful.

248
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,590
Don't tell me.

249
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,340
Eight...

250
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,220
Is it a living thing?

251
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,720
Yes.

252
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,350
It's...

253
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,230
It's me, isn't it?

254
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,520
Calm down! Let's confirm it!

255
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,780
You can touch it.

256
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,610
It isn't an electrical appliance.

257
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,990
It isn't room temperature.

258
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,910
Shinomiya doesn't own it.

259
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,080
She hasn't touched it,and of course, it isn't in her house.

260
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,250
It all matches!

261
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,250
And it's something that Shinomiya likes!

262
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,960
Is this...

263
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,880
a roundabout confession of love?

264
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,340
Nine, in what way do you like it?

265
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,760
THUMP THUMP

266
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,350
As a friend? As a human being?

267
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,760
Or something else?

268
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,060
No answer.

269
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,020
I can only answer with a yes or no.

270
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,150
Crap!

271
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,560
I'm so flustered, I wasted a shot!

272
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,070
I've got to calm down.

273
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,110
It's possiblethat the answer is someone else!

274
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,780
Okay.

275
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,290
Ten, is it somethingthat's very intelligent, handsome,

276
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,080
with somewhat light-colored hairand well-defined eyes?

277
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,340
It's me!

278
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,760
It's me!

279
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,300
It's definitely me!

280
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,810
Jeez, Shinomiya...

281
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,310
What a twisted way to confess your love.

282
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,190
We've been through a lot together, huh?

283
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,610
That's right.

284
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,690
Every time, I understood moreabout the person named Shinomiya.

285
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,860
And...

286
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,070
Huh?

287
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,210
Well, you're out of questions.

288
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,960
Give me your answer.

289
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,800
That's right.

290
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,720
To a certain extent, I understandwhat kind of person Shinomiya is.

291
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,720
At a time like this, she always...

292
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,100
My answer is...

293
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,850
a dog.

294
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,850
Correct.

295
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,610
PESU (DOG)

296
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,020
More precisely,Fujiwara's dog, Pesu.

297
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,900
Good boy! Good boy!You're so cute!

298
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,610
INTELLIGENT

299
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,730
HANDSOME

300
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,150
HANDSOMELIGHT-COLORED HAIR

301
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,900
So shall wego home?

302
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,610
HANDSOMELIGHT-COLORED HAIRWELL-DEFINED EYES

303
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,200
It's getting late, after all.

304
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,820
Right.

305
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,120
The results of today's test...

306
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,120
PASS

307
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,750
BECAUSE WHEN ALL WAS SAID AND DONE,SHIROGANE UNDERSTOOD SHINOMIYA'S NATURE.

308
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,040
Pass.

309
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,880
I FEEL LIKE PESU REMINDS MEOF SOMEONE...

310
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,880
PANT PANT

311
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,430
Kaguya Shinomiya is the daughterof the Shinomiya family,

312
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,010
which was part of oneof the old financial combines.

313
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,510
KAGUYA WANTS TO WALK

314
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,770
Her life was decided when she was bornor perhaps even before she was born.

315
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,140
For example, this...

316
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,650
2,574 times.

317
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,320
That's the number of times

318
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,740
Kaguya Shinomiya has gazedout the window on the way to school.

319
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,030
SHINOMIYA

320
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,820
But one day...

321
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,030
A cat?

322
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,290
Yes.

323
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,790
It's lodged itself in there deepnear the engine.

324
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,550
I'll arrange for another car,so if you would wait for a short while...

325
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,340
In that case, I'll just walk there.

326
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,420
At least go with Hayasaka.

327
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,550
I don't mind.

328
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,560
If she waits for me to change clothes,she'll be late,

329
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,690
and I think she'll be finegoing on her own.

330
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,020
There. You see? I'll be fine.

331
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,070
Miss Kaguya!

332
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,730
See you later.

333
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,950
She was slightly out of breathas she ran under the refreshing sun.

334
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,380
All right.

335
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,640
I may never get the chanceto walk to school again.

336
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,100
I have to take advantageof this precious opportunity.

337
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,390
So...

338
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,270
I believe the presidentrides his bike to school from Setagaya,

339
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:33,780
BICYCLE LANE

340
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,270
so he probably takes Meiji Street.

341
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:33,780
MEIJI STREET

342
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,610
The president always gets to schoolon the late side,

343
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,780
so if I wait on the bridge, I'm sure...

344
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,670
Well, if I don't hurry,I'll miss the president.

345
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,480
What's wrong?

346
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,270
If you've got a problem,briefly tell me what it is.

347
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,400
The pedestrian crossing!

348
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,690
The pedestrian crossing?

349
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,200
All right, I'll cross with you.

350
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,710
Okay. Would you let go of me now?

351
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,970
There are a lot of pedestrian crossingson the way to school!

352
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,440
Before today,

353
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,150
how did you go to school?

354
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,440
With a friend.

355
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,820
Yeti always held my handwhen we crossed.

356
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,240
The Abominable Snowman?

357
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,870
Her name is Ienaga,so her nickname is Yeti.

358
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,120
But now that we're in the upper grades,

359
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,580
she said there's no moregroup walking to school.

360
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,830
So now, I'm on my own.

361
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,380
WAAAH WAAAH

362
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,510
Her thinking is still totally lower grade.

363
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,890
I had a better head on my shoulderseven when I was in the lower grades.

364
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,900
I don't want to be alone!

365
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,900
I want to be with everyone else!

366
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,700
Listen.

367
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,830
Just because going to school in a groupis officially over,

368
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,160
that doesn't meanyou have to walk to school by yourself.

369
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,590
You should meet up somewherewith your friend

370
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,800
or pick her up at her houseand walk together.

371
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,090
Right?

372
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,430
You're smart! Are you a genius?

373
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,850
What can I say?

374
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,390
Mikiti!

375
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,060
Yeti!

376
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,440
Well, you're fine now, right?

377
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,770
Go on.

378
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,560
Right!

379
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,320
Bye-bye, genius girl!

380
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,660
Good morning! Surprised to see me?

381
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,070
Good morning! You did surprise me!

382
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,330
- Let's go to school together!- Yeah!

383
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,330
Well, where am I?

384
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,210
Eight twenty-five.

385
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,630
I'm going to be late.

386
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,630
If they find out I was late,

387
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,470
I'll never be allowedto go to school on my own again.

388
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,600
I wanted to try doing it even just once.

389
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,240
Going to school with someone...

390
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,290
President?

391
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,000
Shinomiya?

392
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,000
What are you doing here?

393
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,130
The bell's gonna ring!

394
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,960
You, too. President, are you going to beâ€”

395
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,880
I'm not late yet!

396
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
I've never been late yet!

397
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,380
You're the problem, Shinomiya!

398
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,760
If you walk, you'll definitely be late!

399
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,760
If a member of the ShuchiinStudent Council is late,

400
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
it sets a bad example!

401
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,020
Hop on the back!

402
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,480
We've gotta fly!

403
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,650
Being late is bad,but two people on a bike is okay?

404
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,650
Be quiet!When it comes to student council,

405
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,780
school rules take priorityover traffic rules!

406
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,970
Days later...

407
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,800
Kaguya has returned to her usual routineof going to school by car.

408
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,930
- Can I go to your house, Yeti?- Sure! Come over!

409
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,930
But sometimes...

410
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,730
she remembers that one day and smiles.

411
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,410
Go back to the forest.
