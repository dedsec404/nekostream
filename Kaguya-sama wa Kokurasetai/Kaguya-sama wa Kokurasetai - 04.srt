00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,980
Meow.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,480
Is that right?

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,480
See? That's cute!

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,610
Yes. Cat ears are your time, Fujiwara,as to Shinomiya is me.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,320
I know, right?

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,240
{\an8}In other words,

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,200
{\an8}the time you brought was originallyShinomiya and cat ears alone.

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,250
You're scaring me!

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,750
{\i1}Cat ears and girls!{\i0}

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,880
{\i1}Mutualism!{\i0}

11

{\i1}There are relationships in this worldthat are naturally symbiotic.{\i0}

{\i1}And cats...{\i0}

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,390
{\i1}Cats, which a great majorityof humans love.{\i0}

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,940
{\i1}And here we have Kaguya Shinomiya,a graceful girl.{\i0}

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,980
{\an8}{\i1}How will the compatibilityof those two things be reflected in him?{\i0}

19
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,110

France is the biggest cosplaying nationright after Japan.

27
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,260
With cosplaying, you don't need words.

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,340
There's no better wayto overcome the language barrier

29
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,300
and deepen our friendship!

30
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,260
But still...

31
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,350
What do you think, President?

32
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,390

{\an8}{\i1}Cute!{\i0}

37
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,690
Not bad, I guess.

{\an8}{\i1}No good! Whenever I look at Shinomiya,my face tenses up!{\i0}

{\an8}{\i1}I need to calm down and look normal!{\i0}

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,370
That's a scary look!

41
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,750
{\i1}Not much of a reaction.{\i0}

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,750
{\i1}It looks like this kind of thingdoesn't suit me.{\i0}

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,760
{\i1}It'd probably look better on someonewith more charm, like Miss Fujiwara.{\i0}

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,840
{\an8}Wh-What is it?

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,760
{\an8}What's what?

46
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,470
You wear a pair, too, President.

{\an8}You don't hold back, do you?

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,980
You knew beforehandthat this wouldn't look good on me.

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,020
True!

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,070

{\i1}It'll be obvious to himthat I think he looks cute!{\i0}

What's wrong, Shinomiya?

62
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,760
{\i1}Since it's come to this...{\i0}

63

Oh, it's nothing.

00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,390
{\i1}Skill... Biting one's tongue!{\i0}

65
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,390
{\i1}But that's not a perfect method.{\i0}

What's the smirk for, Shinomiya?

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,820
Is there somethingyou'd like to say about my cat ears?

71
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,280
No, not at all.

{\an8}GRIN GRIN

73
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,910
They look...

74
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,160
very good on you.

75
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,910
{\i1}That expression!{\i0}

76
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,660
{\i1}As if looking at a bug!{\i0}

77
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,790
{\i1}Does it mean I look so terriblethat I barely qualify as human?{\i0}

78
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,290
Miss Fujiwara,let's take a photo of the president.

79
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,300
Good idea!

80
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,010
We have to preserve this momentfor future generations.

81
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,010
{\i1}She means for extortion!{\i0}

82
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,890
{\i1}She'll put it away and use itas a bargaining chip someday!{\i0}

83
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,770
Forget about it!

84
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,430
Don't be like that.

85
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,890
Kaguya, you, too.

86
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,900
Me, too?

87
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,150
Shinomiya, too?

88
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,150
{\i1}If she takes my photo,she'll have me by the short hairs.{\i0}

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,150
{\i1}But...{\i0}

90
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,780
{\an8}{\i1}at the same time, I'll legally be ableto obtain a cute photo of her like this!{\i0}

91
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,280
{\i1}A balanced scale!{\i0}

94
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,540
If you're going to take it,do it now, Fujiwara!

95
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,040
{\i1}Shirogane chooses the cute side.{\i0}

96
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,800
{\i1}A side he would normally never choose!{\i0}

97
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,630
O-Oh. Take it with the 4K thing!

98
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,550
R-Right!

99
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,970
{\i1}Damn it! She's even cuterwhen I'm standing right next to her!{\i0}

100
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,060
{\i1}The muscles in my face are stiffening!{\i0}

101
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,730
{\i1}I can't believe that looks so good on him.{\i0}

102
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,900
{\i1}No! My mouth is smiling by itself again!{\i0}

103
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,020
C-Could both of yougive me a cheerful smile?

104
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,280
- I can't!- I can't!

105
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,780
{\an8}{\i1}I want to get closer to his cuteness!{\i0}

106
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,780
{\i1}I have to burn this image into my memoryfrom a shorter distance!{\i0}

107
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,280
Why are you glaring at each other?

108
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,040
If you're going to fight,I'm going to confiscate these!

109
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,040
{\an9}NAB

110
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,670
{\i1}What was I doing?{\i0}

111
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,420
{\i1}I feel like I was possessed.{\i0}

112
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,430
{\i1}Scary!{\i0}

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,180
{\an8}CAT EARS ARE SCARY

114
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,180
{\i1}- Cat ears are scary!- Cat ears are scary!{\i0}

{\an5}HENCEFORTH, ALL MEMBERSOF STUDENT COUNCILARE BANNED FROM WEARING CAT EARS

119
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,190
Um, the welcome party is next Monday.

120
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,200
{\an8}Other than making decorations, we needto go shopping for souvenir sweets.

121
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,200
{\an1}THE STUDENT COUNCILWANTS IT TO BE SAID

122
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,450
{\an8}We probably need two people for that.

123
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,410
{\an8}We'll need a few other things, too,

124
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,460
{\an8}and enough for all of the participants,so that's a lot of stuff.

125
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,170
Which means giving up our day offto go shopping.

126
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,170
What a pain.

127
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,170
Boy, what a pain.

128
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,340
Who'd wanna do that?

129
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,970
You know, Shinomiya?

130
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,640
Well, true.

131
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,390
We'll be in troubleif no one wants to do it.

132
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,480
Well, if it's really necessary, I could do it.

{\an8}FIDGET FIDGET

134
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,560
{\an8}Oh!

135
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,020
Why don't we play a game,and the losers have to go?

136
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,520
- A game?- A game?

137
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,570
Yes! The banned word game!

138
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,280
{\an8}THE BANNED WORD GAME

139
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,280
{\i1}The banned word game.{\i0}

140
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,530
Yes!

141
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,120
Here's an example!

142
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,540
I write a word like thisand pass it to the person on my right.

143
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,750
Hold it up and don't look at it.

144
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,080
{\an9}SIMPLE

145
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,170
That's the word that person can't say.

146
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,010
I get it. So you don't knowwhat your own banned word is.

147
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,720
Simple.

148
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,090
You're out!

149
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,390
Okay, let's do it for real!

150
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,520
I pass it to the person on my right.

151
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,390
In that case...

152
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,730
{\i1}I should write a wordthat Fujiwara would be likely to say.{\i0}

153
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,360
{\i1}But the second and third place peoplewill go shopping.{\i0}

154
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,900
{\an9}FIRST PLACE DOESN'T GOSECOND AND THIRD PLACE GO

155
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,700
{\i1}Well, a man is neededfor the physical labor,{\i0}

156
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,700
{\an7}STRONGER(THAN WOMEN)

157
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,160
{\i1}while no one knows moreabout traditional sweets than Shinomiya.{\i0}

158
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,160
{\an7}CERTIFIED TEA EXPERTKNOWLEDGEABLE

159
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,790
{\an8}{\i1}It's just a matter of efficiency.{\i0}

160
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,540
{\i1}Therefore, I need to let Fujiwara winwhile I beat Shinomiya.{\i0}

161
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,790
FIRST PLACE: FUJIWARASECOND PLACE: METHIRD PLACE: SHINOMIYA

162
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,050
{\an8}CHECK-IT-OUT

163
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,050
{\i1}I'm sure Fujiwara would never say this!{\i0}

164
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,050
{\i1}I'll win for sure!{\i0}

165
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,050
{\an7}CHECK-IT-OUT

166
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,050
All right, are we ready?

167
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,730
Yo, yo, let's get started, yo!

168
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,020
Fujiwara?

169
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,150
When I play da banned word game,

170
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,030
people always be choosin' words n' phrasesI be sayin', but not now, yo!

171
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,610
I be changin' da way I speak,so my words be different, yo! Too bad, man!

172
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
{\i1}No!{\i0}

173
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,120
{\i1}Don't look at her!I don't want her to lose!{\i0}

174
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,120
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

175
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,120
{\an8}{\i1}Crap, she'll end up saying, "check-it-out."{\i0}

176
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,130
Kaguya, what ya think your word is, yo?

177
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,750
Say "Hooo!"

178
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,760
Say "Hooo!"

179
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,760
Say "Hooo"...

180
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,510
{\i1}That's childish!{\i0}

181
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,640
{\i1}There's a surefire way to win this game.{\i0}

182
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,140
{\i1}That's by not talking at all!{\i0}

183
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,900
Say "Yay!" Say "Yay!"

184
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,020
{\an8}Shinomiya...

185
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,020
Say "Yay!"

186
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,610
We won't get anywhere like that.

187
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,240
At the bare minimum,speak enough to make it a conversation.

188
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,780
If you insist.

189
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,320
Fine.

190
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,280
{\i1}Inevitable behavior.{\i0}

191
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,280
{\an8}INEVITABLE BEHAVIOR

192
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,000
{\i1}"That person would do this.""This person would say this."{\i0}

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,580
{\i1}This game produces a situation that drawsthe designated word out of your opponent.{\i0}

194
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,800
{\i1}But how am I going to get herto say that banned word?{\i0}

195
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,800
{\an9}LOVE

196
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,760
{\i1}My instinct is telling me, "You've spenthalf a year trying to get her to say that!{\i0}

197
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,380
{\i1}It's impossible!"{\i0}

198
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,800
{\an5}LOVE

199
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,090
{\an8}{\i1}But wait!{\i0}

200
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,680
{\an8}{\i1}I can steer the conversation towardssomething that Shinomiya loves doing.{\i0}

201
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,310
Fujiwara,

202
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,310
is there something you hate?

203
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,440
{\i1}Shirogane passedthe word "hate" on to Fujiwara,{\i0}

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,440
{\i1}a word that can easilybe connected to "love."{\i0}

205
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,320
What I hate?

206
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,070
Let's see.

207
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:00,320
People often tell me I'm not goodat reading a situation, yo.

208
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,290
{\an8}But they also say that's a good thing, yo.

209
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,960
But when they talk about love and stuff,they don't include me!

210
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,550
They say I'd be sureto step on a land mine!

211
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,050
{\i1}That's sound judgment.{\i0}

212
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,680
{\an8}When I think about making problemsfor people without even realizing it,

213
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,050
{\an8}it makes me sad.

214
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,560
That's what I hate.

215
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,140
{\an8}Miss Fujiwara...

216
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,030
I've never thoughtyou've caused problems for me.

217
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,440
In fact,

218
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,530
there are many people who've been helpedby your straightforwardness.

219
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,580
Kaguya...

220
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,910
{\an8}Really?

221
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,830
{\an8}You don't hate me?

222
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,920
Well, I mean... I...

223
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,590
love you.

224
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,460
You're out, yo!

225
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,220
{\an4}LOVE

226
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,970
{\i1}Inevitable behavior!{\i0}

227
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,010
{\i1}When all is said and done,it was inevitable...{\i0}

228
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,810
{\i1}that caring Kaguya would tryto comfort a depressed Fujiwara!{\i0}

229
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,850
{\i1}Fujiwara read that.{\i0}

230
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,350
{\i1}That was nasty!{\i0}

231
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,610
Was all that a lie?

232
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,990
It wasn't a lie, but a bluff, yo!

233
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,240
Of course people would include mein conversations about love interests, yo!

234
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,910
{\an8}{\i1}Since we've gotten this far,the rest should be easy.{\i0}

235
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,870
{\an8}{\i1}I'll lose automatically by lettingmy guard down and following her lead.{\i0}

236
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,790
{\an8}{\i1}She's got everything she needs to win.{\i0}

237
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,000
{\an8}{\i1}But...{\i0}

238
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,670
Hey, when it rains, it pours, yo!

239
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,920
{\an8}{\i1}was that the truth?{\i0}

240
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,040
{\an8}{\i1}She said it was a bluff,{\i0}

241
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,590
{\an8}{\i1}but a bluff has power becauseit's a pinch of a lie mixed with truth.{\i0}

242
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,590
It must be nice, having no troubles.

243
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,590
{\an8}{\i1}If that's the case,how much of it was a lie?{\i0}

244
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,430
{\i1}When Fujiwara was speakingabout feeling alienated,{\i0}

245
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,520
{\i1}were those words and her eyes all lies?{\i0}

246
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,850
{\an8}{\i1}If it's possible that they weren't...{\i0}

247
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,480
{\an8}{\i1}then, I'm playing this game wrong.{\i0}

248
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,110
{\an8}{\i1}I can't stand the idea of hurting othersfor the sake of my own self-interest.{\i0}

249
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,530
{\an8}{\i1}That's my credo,and this situation relates to it.{\i0}

250
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,280
{\an8}{\i1}Prioritizing my own circumstancesand purposely losing...{\i0}

251
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,540
{\an8}{\i1}That would be self-interestand truly alienate her!{\i0}

252
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,160
{\an8}{\i1}The idea of going out shoppingwith Shinomiya may be appealing,{\i0}

253
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,290
{\an8}{\i1}but...{\i0}

254
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,540
{\an8}{\i1}I can't betray my own conviction!{\i0}

255
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,130
Fujiwara...

256
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,050
I'm going to get serious here!

257
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,800
You're out, yo!

258
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,970
Yes! I beat the president, too!

259
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,730
Yay! Yay!

260
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,850
{\an8}{\i1}Inevitable behavior.{\i0}

261
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,650
{\an8}{\i1}An action a person would necessarily takegiven certain circumstances.{\i0}

262
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:39,190
SERIOUS

263
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,940
{\an8}{\i1}And predicting thatis the essential point of the game.{\i0}

264
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,070
Shopping, huh?

265
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,700
Well, we lost,so I guess we can't complain.

266
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,710
{\i1}The banned word game is a game thatdemands understanding of your opponents.{\i0}

267
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,210
{\an8}Ah, dammit.

268
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,790
I lost.

269
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,750
We're going to buy the souvenirs.

270
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,010
{\an5}RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:UTTER DEFEAT FOR SHIROGANE

271
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,720
{\an8}{\i1}Results of today's match...Utter defeat for Shirogane.{\i0}

272
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,670
All right! I'm looking forwardto seeing what you get, yo!

273
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,720
{\an5}THE HEART THROBBINGSHOPPING ARC CONTINUES

274
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,970
{\an9}CHECK-IT-OUT

275
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,970
"Check-it-out"?

276
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,140
The president said we'd talkabout shopping after he got back.

277
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,850
Oh.

278
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,190
The day he bought a smartphone,

279
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,860
we exchanged e-mail addressesand phone numbers.

280
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,940
{\an8}But I've been waiting and waiting,and he still hasn't contacted me!

281
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,860
{\an8}He has no intentionof sending me a message first!

282
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,110
{\an8}"President, I'm looking forwardto tomorrow—"

283
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,700
{\an8}What are you doing?

284
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,490
{\an8}Well, I thoughtI'd send a text on your behalf.

285
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,370
{\an8}Don't! I'm not sending the first text!

286
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,080
KAGUYA WANTS HIM TO SEND IT

287
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,080
{\an8}All this beating around the bush...

288
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,500
Lady Kaguya, you're in lovewith President Shirogane, aren't you?

289
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,760
I have feelings for the president.

290
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,090
Then...

291
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:54,520
But I'm only interestedbecause he's got the elements I lack.

292
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,520
{\an8}It's definitely not love.

293
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,020
Then, what if the secretary starteddating President Shirogane?

294
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,780
Well?

295
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,360
You've got it wrong!

296
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,450
I wouldn't want the presidentto take Miss Fujiwara away from me!

297
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,290
Despite appearances,she's my dear friend.

298
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,410
{\an7}From: FujiwaraSubject: OctopusLook! A live octopus!!

299
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,420
She's your dear friend, right?

300
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,670
{\an8}If it weighs on your mind that much,

301
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,800
{\an8}Lady Kaguya...

302
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,170
instead of a text, why not call?

303
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,880
C-Call?

304
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,890
He's expecting a text.

305
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,100
Exploit that carelessness,and attack this way!

306
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,890
Carelessness? Attack?

307
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,100
It's the perfect plan.

308
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,610
Before Lady Kaguya quibbles about it,click-click there.

309
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,110
Here you go.

310
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,110
Wait! I'm not mentally prepared!

311
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,030
{\an8}SHIROGANE

312
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,030
{\an5}RINGING

313
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,030
{\i1}Hello?{\i0}

314
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,700
This is Shinomiya.

315
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,410
President, is that you?

316
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,910
I'm Miyuki's father.

317
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:03,170
{\i1}U-Um, is the president...I mean, is Shirogane there?{\i0}

318
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,590
I am Shirogane.

319
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,630
{\i1}No, I mean...{\i0}

320
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,130
i-is Miyuki there?

321
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,800
{\i1}Oh, my son?{\i0}

322
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,760
{\i1}Miyuki! A girl's on the phone for you!{\i0}

323
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,310
{\i1}A girl's calling for him?{\i0}

324
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,390
{\i1}Wha... You don't answeranother person's cell phone, Dad!{\i0}

325
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,150
It's me.

326
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,520
It's Shinomiya.

327
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,030
{\i1}Oh, Shinomiya?{\i0}

328
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,700
I was calling about the plan for tomorrow.

329
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,240
Is now okay?

330
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,910
{\i1}Sure.{\i0}

331
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,160
I'm in the tub, but that's fine.

332
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,040
The tub?

333
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,620
Then he's naked, huh?

334
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,040
{\an8}Lady Kaguya, right now you're talkingto someone who's completely exposed.

335
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,040
{\i1}It's muffled on your end.{\i0}

336
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,170
I-I'll call you back!

337
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,800
{\i1}No problem.{\i0}

338
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,170
My phone is waterproof.

339
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,050
{\i1}There is a problem.{\i0}

340
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,640
How about we meet tomorrowat 11 am in front of Hachiko?

341
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,800
{\i1}Okay.{\i0}

342
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,810
We'll buy the sweets, then go to Hands.

343
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,520
I guess that's about it.

344
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,310
Right.

345
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,060
{\an9}STRETCH OUT THE CONVERSATION MORE

346
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,310
{\i1}Well, I'll see you tomorrow.{\i0}

347
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,060
Yes.

348
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,520
{\i1}Shinomiya—{\i0}

349
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,820
What? What were you about to say?

350
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm going to sleep.

351
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,330
{\an3}FROM: SHIROGANEI WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU SOMETHINGAS YOU HUNG UP THE PHONE

352
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,920

353
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,550
Good for you. Your first text.

354
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,510
{\i1}Results of today's match... Kaguya wins.{\i0}

355
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,920
{\an8}RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:KAGUYA WINS

356
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,430
THE NEXT DAY

357
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,430
It seems Shibuya Station is flooded.

358
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,180
I'm going.

359
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,270
The president is waiting for me.

360
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,770
I have to go!

361
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,190
{\an8}There's no way he's there.

362
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,700
A text canceling our plans...

363
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,450
But it's the first textShinomiya has sent me, right?

364
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,500
So I'll call that a win for today.

365
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,580
Thankfully, my phone is waterproof.

366
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,590
{\an8}THE END OF THE HEART THROBBINGSHOPPING ARC

367
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,960
{\an3}TOOK 30 MINUTESTO SEND THE CANCELLATION TEXT.

368
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,550
FRENCH FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENTSWELCOME PARTY

369
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,800
We got it ready in time!

370
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,180
Good work, everyone!

371
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,810
{\an8}Headmaster, next time,please don't tell us so last-minute.

372
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,150
MIYUKI SHIROGANE WANTS TO TALK

373
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,690
{\an8}Understood!

374
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,270
Well, everyone, have a good time!

375
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,450
Can you speak French, Shinomiya?

376
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,570
No. Not very well.

377
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,070
How about you, President?

378
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,710
I AM MIYUKI SHIROGANE

379
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,670
You're not the president for nothing.

380
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,340
I just prepared by studying the handbook.

381
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,470
U-Um...

382
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,480
{\i1}Liar!{\i0}

383
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,950
You can speak French?

384
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,070
Yes!

385
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,330
My mom is a former diplomat,

386
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,870
so ever since I was little, she drummedvarious languages into my head.

387
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,580
{\i1}Wait a second.{\i0}

388
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,420
{\an8}{\i1}Am I the only person herewho can't speak French?{\i0}

389
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
{\an8}COMPLETELY ISOLATED

390
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,920
{\i1}He's completely isolated!{\i0}

391
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,970
{\i1}Wh-Wh-What should I do?{\i0}

392
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,430
{\i1}If they figure outI'm the only one who doesn't speak it...{\i0}

393
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,850
{\i1}President of student councilof a Japanese school can't speak French?{\i0}

394
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,930
{\i1}Maybe he's just dumb.{\i0}

395
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,320
HOW CUTE...

396
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,820
{\i1}This is bad, bad for my heart.{\i0}

397
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,700
{\i1}Shirogane...{\i0}

398
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,700
{\i1}why do you think I suddenly asked youto prepare a party?{\i0}

399
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,740
{\i1}I must determine...{\i0}

400
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,210
{\i1}whether you're truly someoneto whom this academy can be entrusted.{\i0}

401
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,460
{\i1}The real test begins now.{\i0}

402
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,800
{\an8}Betsy...

403
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
{\an8}Yes.

404
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,300
{\an8}No need to go easy on him.

405
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,430
{\an8}Make mincemeat out of Miyuki Shiroganewith everything you've got.

406
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,640
{\an8}Are you sure?

407
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,980
{\an8}{\i1}Betsy Beltoise, the vice-presidentof the French school's student council.{\i0}

408
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,810
{\i1}Her nickname is "The Wound-licking Razor."{\i0}

409
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:36,730
{\an9}THE WOUND-LICKING RAZOR

410
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,980
{\i1}No one has ever been imperviousto her verbal attack.{\i0}

411
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,730
{\an5}VERBAL ATTACK

412
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,450
Hey.

413
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,830
{\i1}Betsy's sarcasm is like punchingsomeone you've just met in the face.{\i0}

414
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,080
{\i1}Next, she provokes him as if simultaneouslyinsulting his parents and lover.{\i0}

415
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,260
{\i1}On top of that,she diminishes his character{\i0}

416
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,090
{\i1}in a way that would makea man in his sixties break down in tears.{\i0}

417
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
{\an8}THAT'S IT!

418
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,600
{\i1}Miyuki Shirogane!{\i0}

419
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,730
{\i1}He smiles confidently in the faceof that merciless verbal onslaught?{\i0}

420
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,610
{\i1}I'd be throwing upwhile bowing down on the ground!{\i0}

421
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,110
{\i1}You'd think he couldn't comprehendwhat she was saying!{\i0}

422
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,200
{\i1}My verbal assault isn't getting through!{\i0}

423
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,870
{\i1}That's impossible!{\i0}

424
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,870
{\i1}Betsy unleashes even stronger invectiveagainst Shirogane.{\i0}

425
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,010
What was that?

426
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,010
You...

427
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,100
{\an8}Oh, sorry.You don't understand Japanese, do you?

428
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,030
{\i1}Kaguya menaces Betsy with language that'dget the attention of the Broadcasting Code.{\i0}

429
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,540
Shinomiya?

430
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,580
P-President!

431
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,290
Don't get the wrong idea! That was...

432
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,130
She... She's going to kill me!

433
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,790
I'm sorry. I-It's okay.

434
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,050
{\an8}Japanese high school girls are scary!

435
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,090
{\i1}Oh, what did I do?{\i0}

436
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,800
{\i1}Exhibition match. The Japanese school won.{\i0}

437
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,800
{\an7}EXHIBITION MATCHTHE JAPANESE SCHOOL WON

438
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,310
I bet you look down on me now.

439
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,440
After being so foul-mouthed...

440
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,820
This is like the old me.

441
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,530
{\an8}Like I said at the beginning,I skimmed the French handbook.

442
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,330
{\an8}I couldn't have caught what you said.

443
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,830
So, I have no ideawhat you were saying to her.

444
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,170
I just know you were madbecause she was badmouthing me.

445
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,340
Thank you.

446
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,630
President!

447
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,840
That's one thing I...

448
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,720
...about you.

449
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,350
What?

450
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,730
What did you say?

451
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,270
It's a secret.

452
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,230
Hey, don't do that to me!

453
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,860
It only makes me wanna know more!

454
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,440
A secret is a secret.

455
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,730
What did you say?

456
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,570
{\an8}{\i1}Results of today's match...{\i0}

457

{\an5}RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:BOTH WINNERS

458
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,240
It wasn't in French.

459
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,990
{\an8}{\i1}Both winners.{\i0}

460
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,990
- In Latin?- No.
