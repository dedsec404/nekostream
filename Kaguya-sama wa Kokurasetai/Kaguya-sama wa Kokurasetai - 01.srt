1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,270
CONFESSION

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,430
CONFESSION

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,730
You fall in love with someone...

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,110
P-Please be my girlfriend!

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,480
confess that love...

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,110
and become a couple.

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,120
Everyone would say that's a wonderful thing.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,040
But they're wrong!

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,960
Even among sweethearts,there exists a distinct power relationship!

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,420
A side that exploitsand a side that's exploited,

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,590
a side that's devoted,a side receiving devotion,

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,510
a winner and a loser!

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,020
If you're trying to live a noble life,then you mustn't become a loser.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,640
Love is war!

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,820
The person who falls in love loses!

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,030
KAGUYA-SAMA: LOVE IS WAR

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,620
Shuchiin Academy!

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,750
It's a prestigious schoolwith an ancient and honorable origin,

19
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,380
founded as a facilityto educate upper-crust children.

20
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,260
The focus on the nobility is gone,

21
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,930
but many talented studentsborn into wealthy, distinguished families

22
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,220
How do you do?

23
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,930
and shouldering the futureattend the school.

24
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,510
How do you do?

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,850
Naturally ordinary people wouldn't be permittedto lead and bring these students together!

26
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,610
Everyone, look!

27
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,610
The Student Council members!

28
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,200
Kaguya Shinomiya, the vice-presidentof the Student Council at Shuchiin Academy.

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,860
Total assets: 200 trillion yen.

30
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,410
Her family owns the Shinomiya Group,

31
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,790
one of the top four financial conglomeratesin Japan, with over 1,000 subsidiaries.

32
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,500
SHINOMIYA BANK

33
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,710
Befitting her superior lineage,she's a talented young woman

34
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,250
who has attainedsplendid achievements in various fields,

35
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,050
such as traditional performing arts,music, and martial arts.

36
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,420
That is Kaguya Shinomiya.

37
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,470
And the young man Shinomiya supports is...

38
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,640
Miyuki Shirogane, the presidentof the Student Council at Shuchiin Academy.

39
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,940
He's wise and intelligent,strong and silent.

40
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,770
He scores first placein the practice exams.

41
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,520
In contrast to talented Kaguya,

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,400
his devotion to studyingcommands awe and fear,

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,690
and because of that exemplary behavior,

44
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,410
PRESIDENT OF STUDENT COUNCIL

45
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,240
he was selected to bethe Student Council president,

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,990
despite being relatively new to the school.

47
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,740
The weight of a solid gold braided cordhas been passed down

48
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,410
from president to presidentat Shuchiin Academy for 200 years!

49
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,170
Those two always look so good together.

50
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,920
There's even a dignity to them!

51
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,880
Do you think they're dating?

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,180
- Somebody, please ask them!- I wouldn't dare!

53
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,340
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM

54
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,720
It would be presumptuous to even get closeto them, let alone ask such a question!

55
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,700
It seems...

56
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,160
I WILL MAKE YOUINVITE ME TO A MOVIE

57
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,120
there's a rumor going around...

58
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,080
that we're in a relationship or some such.

59
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,700
That's normal for their age.

60
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,830
You should ignore it.

61
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,330
That's all it is?

62
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,590
They think Shinomiya and I are dating?

63
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,340
The fools certainly do enjoytalking about nonsensical love affairs.

64
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,720
Although...

65
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,730
if Shinomiya demanded that I go out with her,I suppose I would mull it over!

66
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,810
And I'm certain she has feelings for me.

67
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,570
Probably just a matter of time.

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,900
She should just take off the maskof a perfect, pampered young lady

69
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,570
Shirogane, I need to talk to you.

70
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,610
and make her blushing appeal to me.

71
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,950
The ignorant children with their common talk.

72
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,580
Who do they think I am?

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm a member of the Shinomiya family,the heart of this country.

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,590
How did they reach the conclusionthat I would be dating a commoner?

75
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,970
Well, I suppose there could bea very slight possibility.

76
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,770
If he got on his knees and offered uphis body, soul, and hometown,

77
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,730
I suppose I could train himto be a man who measures up to me.

78
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,690
Certainly, there's no manwho doesn't pine for me.

79
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,730
It's probably just a matter of time.

80
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,240
While they were engagingin this kind of thing...

81
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,700
half a year passed!

82
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,420
Nothing of note happened during that period.

83
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,340
By the way, today there were snails

84
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,050
in the interior of the apple and cherry reliefin the courtyard's water fountain.

85
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,310
My younger sister once caught a coldtaking a dip in the water fountain,

86
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,640
even though it was hot outside.

87
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,310
When you act according to emotions,nothing good results.

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
During this period of nothingness,

89
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,900
their thoughts shifted from,"I wouldn't mind dating him/her"

90
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,820
to "Maybe I'll make him/herconfess his/her love to me."

91
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,660
Meanwhile, one other person had no ideathat two super high school-level minds

92
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,700
STEAMED BUN

93
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,870
were engaged in sophisticated strategizing!

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,660
SHUCHIIN ACADEMYSTUDENT COUNCIL SECRETARY

95
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,660
That reminds me! Listen to this!

96
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,660
CHIKA FUJIWARA

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,670
I won a pair of movie tickets, butmy parents won't let me see stuff like that,

98
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,420
STEAMED BUN

99
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,180
LOVE REFRAIN

100
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,180
So are you two interested?

101
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,930
NOTE: CHEAPSKATE

102
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,930
Hmm.

103
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,680
Come to think of it,I have a rare free weekend.

104
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,720
So, Shinomiya, why don't we—

105
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,770
Supposedly there's a jinx.If a boy and a girl

106
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,440
go see this movie together,they'll become a couple.

107
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,690
How romantic!

108
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,650
Oh, Shirogane.

109
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,940
Did you just invite me?

110
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,950
You want to go with me to a moviein which males and females

111
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,040
are said to become a coupleif they see it together.

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,410
Oh, dear, that sounds a lot like...

113
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,710
Like I'm asking her out on a date!

114
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,840
Shirogane's predicament was,in romance,

115
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,920
"The person who falls in love loses"is the rule!

116
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,590
As they were both full of pride, neither onecould confess one iota of romantic interest!

117
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,100
What should I do? It's blatant.The only thing I can do is smooth it over!

118
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,600
Why don't we sell the tickets to a scalper?

119
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,860
Oh, Shirogane,I've never seen you this flustered before.

120
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,570
It's cute.

121
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,120
This is unacceptable! There is no escape routeon the path that Shirogane conquers!

122
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,420
You're the onewho's going to run, Shinomiya!

123
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,750
Yeah, I invited you, Shinomiya.

124
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,760
I don't care about rumors like that,but it seems you do.

125
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,850
Do you want to see this movie with me?

126
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,760
LOVE REFRAIN

127
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,760
That moment, Shinomiya thought...

128
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,350
After indicating the intent to invite me,

129
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,770
he assigned me the choiceof whether we see the movie or not.

130
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,650
Well played.

131
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,440
I could choose to refuse,

132
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,030
but then all of my preliminary arrangementsup to now would become meaningless.

133
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,530
WINNER

134
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,330
I went to all the trouble of fabricating a prizeand putting it in Chika's mailbox.

135
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,540
All right!

136
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:46,000
My plan to aim for one of Shirogane'srare free days would be for nothing!

137
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,550
LOVE REFRAIN

138
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,550
And if I turn him down now,

139
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,800
Shirogane may never invite meto anything again!

140
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,050
From the viewpoint of a young lady, I say no!And I say no to that kind of choice!

141
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,800
LOVE REFRAIN

142
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,220
Yes, well...

143
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,560
I can't help believing in stories like that.

144
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,020
So if we are going,

145
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,440
I'd like you to at least invite mewith more passion.

146
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,450
MISS INNOCENT

147
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,780
"Miss Innocent" skill implemented!

148
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,240
It's a negotiating skill passed onfrom father to child in the Shinomiya family.

149
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,790
It's said this calculated expression and voiceeven make the gods' hearts beat faster.

150
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,870
In truth, Shirogane's thoughtswere also in disarray.

151
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,880
Well, I guess it's the man's dutyto ask a woman out.

152
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,550
That thought crossed his mind!

153
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,050
Of course, Shinomiya didn'tlet that chance go by!

154
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,720
She pursued without a moment's delay!

155
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,930
LOVE REFRAIN

156
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,510
I'm at the age where I'd like to trya little romance, too.

157
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,890
This battle of thoughtsseemed to be like a chess problem.

158
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,650
Shinomiya cornered Shirogane, who searchedfor an opportunity to turn it around.

159
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,610
The brains of these prodigiesraced two steps ahead,

160
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,860
clashing with each other as wheelsturned faster than any ordinary mind!

161
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,530
Kaguya strengthened her defense.

162
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,160
Shirogane tried to break through!

163
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,660
They both constructed a theoryleading to a conclusion!

164
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,330
The one who completed the theory firstwould be the winner!

165
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,420
If you don't like love stories,you can also use the tickets...

166
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,880
to go see the movie,"The Birdie from Tottori."

167
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,880
“The Birdie...

168
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,380
...from Tottori”?

169
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,180
Chaos theory.

170
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,850
Secretary Fujiwara's casual remark

171
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,140
added an element of chaosinto the theories that were all but completed!

172
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:31,360
It was only one element, but like the Big Bang,the chaos increased the possibilities.

173
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,320
In order to processthe vastly expanded choices,

174
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,700
Um, is something wrong?

175
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,910
the wheels in their brains spun even faster,going beyond their limits!

176
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,280
As a result, their brainscraved a great deal of sugar!

177
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
SUGAR

178
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,290
The only sugar in the Student Council officewas in a single steamed bun!

179
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,420
Thus, whoever obtained the steamed bunwould be the winner!

180
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,090
Afternoon classes are about to start.

181
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,010
Well, see you again after school.

182
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,600
It was a sophisticatedromantic battle of the brains,

183
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,230
with the ingenuity and prideof these two geniuses on the line.

184
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,980
TODAY'S BATTLE RESULT

185
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,980
BOTH SIDES DEFEATED

186
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,030
I repeat, it was a sophisticatedromantic battle of the brains,

187
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,240
with the ingenuity and prideof these two geniuses on the line!

188
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,500
Huh?

189
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,960
KAGUYA WANTSTO BE STOPPED

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,500
Oh.

191
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,960
Oh dear, huh?

192
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,300
A love letter?

193
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,260
Yes.

194
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,140
He was very passionate,even asking me out to dinner.

195
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,010
In other words, he invited you out on a date?

196
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,770
A love letter to Shinomiya?

197
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,520
Some men really are fools for love.

198
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,940
We're talking about Shinomiyawho usually passes the time looking at me.

199
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,820
Does this fellow know, next to me,any other male in the vicinity

200
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,530
would only registeras a talking weed?

201
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,530
MR. WEED

202
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,530
Hello!

203
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,660
There's no way Shinomiya would accept.

204
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,280
Do you intend to go on the date?

205
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,580
Of course.

206
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,790
Crack!

207
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,830
You've lost your mind, Shinomiya!

208
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,540
Blindly accepting an invitationfrom someone you've never met!

209
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,340
He's someone who mustered the courageto write me an enthusiastic love letter.

210
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,630
I'm sure I'll fall for him.

211
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,550
Ridiculous!

212
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,590
You think I'll just let this happen?

213
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,890
Somehow, I have to stop Shinomiya!

214
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,850
Don't go on a date with any man but me!

215
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,600
What's that?

216
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:35,100
Oh, my. Do you find the prospect of anotherperson taking me away really that unpleasant?

217
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,110
That's cute.

218
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,030
This is as good as a confession of love!

219
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,120
It's like I'm saying,"Shinomiya, I love you!"

220
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,870
I have to...

221
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,120
I have to avoid that at all costs!

222
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,370
Kaguya, are you really going?

223
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,120
Yes.

224
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,750
I'm really looking forward to it.

225
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,460
At first glance, it seems Kaguya is thinkingonly romantically, without any principles.

226
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,340
As if I would really go.

227
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,630
Flowers must be bloominginside that boy's brain.

228
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,050
Of course it's a bluff!

229
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,760
If he wants to invite me out on a date,he'd better start by offering me a country

230
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,010
and then be worthy of my consideration.

231
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,480
Like I would just go out with himas an act of charity?

232
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,900
Shinomiya had no intentionsof going on a date with a talking weed.

233
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,400
After all, it was only a strategyto get Shirogane to stop her.

234
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,240
A romantic battle of the brains!

235
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,530
As they were both full of pride,neither one could confess romantic interest!

236
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,990
The only thing to dowas use resourcefulness and skill

237
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,250
to make the other personconfess their love!

238
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,790
Is there no way I can naturallykeep her from going? Think!

239
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,000
Intelligence put to the test!

240
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,130
It's pointless.Until Shirogane bows his head

241
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,340
and honestly begs me not to go,I refuse to cancel.

242
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,510
A clever scheme!

243
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,430
That's the romantic battle of the brains!

244
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,760
The ongoing duel between them!

245
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,770
Shinomiya...

246
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,730
as the president of Student Council,

247
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,150
I can't endorseillicit activities with the opposite sex.

248
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,270
The ace up his sleeve.

249
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,360
An ingenious approach.Giving his opinion not as himself,

250
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,030
but as the president of Student Council,doesn't do him any damage.

251
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,530
That's an exaggeration.We're just going out for dinner.

252
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,780
Our teacher will be the judge of that.

253
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,540
Suspension from school is very possible.

254
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,040
If you insist on going, well...

255
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,790
TATTLE TO THE TEACHER!

256
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,790
I'll run it by the teacher!

257
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,880
Tattling to the teacher!

258
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,420
It's tremendously effective,but it's a risky choice,

259
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,220
Naughty, naughty!We're gonna tell the teacher!

260
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,220
since the person who uses itis likely to be labeled a coward.

261
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,230
But for Shirogane, preventing Shinomiya'sdate was more important than his honor.

262
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,390
That determination had an effect on Kaguya.

263
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,230
I didn't think Shirogane would usea forbidden move like that.

264
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,230
GRRR...

265
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,230
But I'm going to stick to my guns!

266
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,230
I don't mind.

267
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,240
If it's true love,I'm prepared to even accept expulsion.

268
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,660
E-Expulsion?

269
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,370
I'm prepared to offer my body and soulfor true love.

270
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,830
Body and soul?

271
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,130
Shirogane takes major damage!

272
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,130
Th...

273
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,090
That's ridiculous!

274
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,630
No, it's not!

275
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,340
He's conveyed his ardent love for me.

276
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,760
Wouldn't it be dishonorable of menot to be prepared for expulsion?

277
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,140
S-Stop being silly!

278
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,010
Then maybe I should confess my love!

279
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,020
For the sake of argument...

280
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,690
Just for argument,

281
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,690
would you be able to forgetabout this boy then?

282
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,570
There...

283
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,950
There's a possibility.

284
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,250
Could something so easily swayedbe true love?

285
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,460
If being wooed by another mancan make you forget him,

286
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,380
then there's no way it's true love!

287
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,840
I just said there's a possibility!

288
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,930
I see, I see. Then it's true love.

289
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,470
If you're worried about me, you shouldstop me without regard to the way it looks!

290
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,480
I don't care what you say!I'm really going!

291
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,730
Unless I get a tearfully passionateconfession of love, I really am going!

292
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,230
Shirogane?

293
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,650
TEARY-EYED

294
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,700
I don't want anyone to have you, Kaguya!

295
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,410
- I don't want you expelled!- Fujiwa...

296
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,790
WAAH

297
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,000
No, no!

298
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,670
- Don't go away!- Hey...

299
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,790
I'm crazy about you!

300
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,210
- I love you!- Enough! I won't go, so get off of me!

301
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,050
Kaguya lost today's battle.

302
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,050
TODAY'S BATTLE RESULT

303
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,050
KAGUYA DEFEATED

304
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,260
A PASSIONATE LOVE LETTER ARRIVED...

305
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,060
BY HAYASAKA

306
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
Forget it!

307
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,060
Why not? Just give me one bite!

308
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,820
All right, but jeez.

309
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,070
Here.

310
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,330
Improper!

311
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,540
Worth getting that angry about?

312
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,830
KAGUYA WANTS IT

313
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,120
They don't have enough self-awareness

314
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,330
about being studentsof traditional Shuchiin Academy.

315
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,340
Coaxing someone like that in public,it's despicable!

316
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,340
It's silly and vulgar!

317
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,170
That's a mean way to put it.

318
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,510
Shirogane, you broughtyour own lunch today?

319
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,100
Yeah. My grandpa in the countrysent us a lot of vegetables.

320
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,140
It may not look great,but I have confidence in the taste.

321
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,060
Miyuki, eat it all up!

322
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,940
It was the first timeKaguya had seen such a lunch.

323
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,860
Kaguya's own lunch was always preparedby a team of chefs

324
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,200
and delivered to herduring the lunch hour.

325
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,240
Her lunch was nutritionally balanced,of course,

326
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,500
achieving harmonywith fresh ingredients as the foundation.

327
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,710
That is the lunch that Kaguya knows.

328
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,920
Boiled food! Red wieners! Rolled omelette!

329
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,380
Hamburger! Pickled dried plum! And...

330
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,220
SEAWEED EGG

331
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,220
seasoning over rice!

332
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,550
All the food one could wantcrammed into a box.

333
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:03,270
It struck Kaguya it was likethe freedom of a child's treasure chest.

334
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,690
Wieners sliced to looklike an octopus! They really exist!

335
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,230
I want to try one, but...

336
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,230
Kaguya's pride wouldn't allow it!

337
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,230
Lunch, lunch.

338
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,740
You brought lunch today?It looks delicious!

339
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,110
I know, right? I made it all myself.

340
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,660
Lucky. Please give me a bite!

341
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,500
Sure, I don't mind.

342
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,250
Really?

343
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,210
I'll give you this hamburger.

344
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,250
All right!

345
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,250
Hey! Chika?

346
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,760
DELICIOUS

347
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,760
It's out of this world!

348
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,020
The piping hot juice that spillsout of a hamburger is delicious,

349
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,940
but there's something specialabout a hamburger

350
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,770
that's yummy at room temperaturewith all of the flavor locked in!

351
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,020
FLAVOR

352
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,020
YUMMY

353
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,020
MEAT JUICES LOCKED IN

354
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,440
- All right, eat this, too.- Yay!

355
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,900
Chika...

356
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,410
I considered you a friend...

357
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,080
but if your life was in danger tomorrow,I wouldn't lift a finger to help you.

358
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,540
What's that scornful stare about?

359
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,290
You...

360
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,380
You think my lunch is that miserable?

361
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,630
Make fun of me?

362
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,260
I'll teach you a lesson!

363
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,390
Hot miso soup!

364
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,770
It's no good if the rice gets cold and hard,but if you have it with miso soup...

365
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,270
in that instant,the two merge into a supreme dish.

366
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Try it.

367
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,770
Sure!

368
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,490
Hey! Why did you take itfrom the part he already ate from?

369
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,780
That's an indirect kiss!

370
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,240
That, too?

371
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,790
The rice! The rice is melting in my mouth!

372
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,880
Yes, just as using cold ricefor cooked rice with green tea

373
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:58,800
FROZEN RICE

374
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,800
DOESN'T STICK TOGETHER

375
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,420
has been traditional for ages,

376
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,800
MIX IT WITH SOUP

377
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,800
there's marvelous compatibilitybetween warm soup and a cold lunch.

378
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,800
BREAKS APART

379
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,800
DELICIOUS!!

380
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,550
This is delicious!You're a genius, Shirogane!

381
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,550
Okay, enough praise!

382
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,550
How about that, Shinomiya?

383
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,930
After all, this isn't secondhand knowledge!

384
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,720
I bet you didn't knowhow good cold rice could be.

385
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,140
It's a discovery basedon experimentation and inspiration!

386
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,560
Kaguya! Kaguya! Kaguya! Kaguya!

387
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,560
He's on the level of Newton,maybe even higher!

388
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,820
Kaguya, let's go home together!

389
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,490
I love getting to do a sleepover with you!

390
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,070
It doesn't hurt, but I'm crying!

391
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,580
Goodbye, Chika. We're no longer friends.

392
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,080
She looks even more contemptuous!

393
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,790
But why?

394
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,210
I see. If that's how you want to play it,then I have an idea, too.

395
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,130
Just wait until tomorrow.

396
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,470
THE NEXT DAY

397
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,600
A lot of effort was put into this.

398
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,100
I just got bitten by the cooking bug.

399
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,900
Huh. It actually looks good.

400
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,320
I know it!Then you're going to ask me, aren't you?

401
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,990
Ask me for a bite.

402
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,990
Then I'll be magnanimous, and...

403
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,660
Gimme! Gimme!

404
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,410
Good grief. Fine, Shirogane,we can exchange lunches.

405
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,000
And that's how I'll accept it.

406
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,500
So come over anytime.

407
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,800
Why don't we eat, too?

408
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,050
Yeah!

409
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,800
Octopus-shaped wieners again today!

410
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,760
Yep. They're a staple.

411
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,470
Nice! They're cute and yummy!Nothing could be better!

412
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,980
I don't know about that.

413
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,400
Why not? That's how I think of them!

414
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
All right, all ri...

415
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,030
Shirogane...

416
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,820
I recall you love oysters.

417
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,120
What is this disturbing aurashe's been giving off since yesterday?

418
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,290
Why is she offering mea meaninglessly high-class dish?

419
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,830
She must be plotting something.Otherwise...

420
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,790
Oh, my.

421
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,040
That's a cute lunch.

422
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,840
I'll give you this out of charity, Shirogane,since I feel sorry for you.

423
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,550
She feels sorry for me?

424
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,720
Th-This is humiliating!

425
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,430
I can't take it.

426
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,180
I will not take it!

427
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,640
I have nothing to give youin exchange for this high-class dish!

428
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,560
I'd be happy with octopus wieners!

429
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,230
Kaguya? Doesn't that hurt?

430
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,060
Is your head okay?

431
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,610
Darn it! That sounds like an insult!

432
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,610
Anyway, what is that?

433
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:31,370
Oh, this?Shirogane made lunch for me, too.

434
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,200
There's no differencein making it for one or two people.

435
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,080
It's delicious!

436
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,330
Really? Good to hear.

437
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,590
Color is important to a lunch box, right?

438
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,880
That's certainly true.

439
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,630
Cattle in human form.

440
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,720
Prideless parasite,relying on someone else to survive.

441
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,300
All that nutrition to your chest,nothing for your brain!

442
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,850
Repulsive creature!

443
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,850
I swear I'll never forgive you.

444
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,350
Shinomiya's eyes are like an assassin's!

445
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,690
Crap! I have the club meeting today!I'd better hurry and eat!

446
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,730
My octopus-shaped wiener!

447
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,110
I'll see you later!

448
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,240
What am I doing?

449
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,870
I feel like a fool.

450
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,000
Kaguya...

451
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,510
It's good, right?

452
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,430
Let's share it!

453
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,190
Chika...

454
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,770
I'm sorry.

455
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,770
I had the wrong idea about you.

456
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,980
You're definitely a human being.

457
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,400
What did you think I was before?

458
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,160
Have confidence.

459
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:59,410
TODAY'S BATTLE RESULT

460
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,740
Today's battle.

461
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,490
I've never lacked confidence about that!

462
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:59,410
DUE TO SHIROGANE'S ESCAPING,VICTORY FOR KAGUYA

463
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Kaguya won.

464
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,170
Good grief.

465
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,550
What a nuisance Shirogane is.

466
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,760
After all that preparation,he still hasn't confessed his love to me.

467
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,680
Kaguya...

468
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,140
purely hypothetically,if you truly fall in love someday,

469
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,850
would you wait for that personto confess their love, like now?

470
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,440
Or would you confess your love?

471
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,650
The romantic battle of the brains.

472
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,440
It's a duel between two souls,with their dignity on the line!

473
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,570
If that time comes, I would considerthe risk of someone stealing him first

474
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,450
and come to the onerational conclusion.

475
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,200
Of course I would go.

476
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,250
I would go.

477
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,790
Please.

478
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,710
Of course I... Of course.

479
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,460
Please understand that she's nothaving trouble because of a silly reason

480
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,630
like "Confessing my lovewould be too embarrassing"

481
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,970
or "What if he turned me down?"

482
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,470
CONFESSION

483
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,060
Who cares? It doesn't even matter!
