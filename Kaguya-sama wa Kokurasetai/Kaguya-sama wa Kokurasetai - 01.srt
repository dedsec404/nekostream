{\an5}CONFESSION

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,430
CONFESSION

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,730
{\i1}You fall in love with someone...{\i0}

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,110
{\an8}P-Please be my girlfriend!

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,480
{\i1}confess that love...{\i0}

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,110
{\i1}and become a couple.{\i0}

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,120
{\i1}Everyone would say that's a wonderful thing.{\i0}

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,040
{\i1}But they're wrong!{\i0}

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,960
{\i1}Even among sweethearts,there exists a distinct power relationship!{\i0}

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,420
{\i1}A side that exploitsand a side that's exploited,{\i0}

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,590
{\i1}a side that's devoted,a side receiving devotion,{\i0}

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,510
{\i1}a winner and a loser!{\i0}

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,020
{\i1}If you're trying to live a noble life,then you mustn't become a loser.{\i0}

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,640
{\i1}Love is war!{\i0}

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,820
{\i1}The person who falls in love loses!{\i0}

{\an8}KAGUYA-SAMA: LOVE IS WAR

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,620
{\i1}Shuchiin Academy!{\i0}

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,750
{\i1}It's a prestigious schoolwith an ancient and honorable origin,{\i0}

19
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,380
{\i1}founded as a facilityto educate upper-crust children.{\i0}

20
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,260
{\i1}The focus on the nobility is gone,{\i0}

21
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,930
{\i1}but many talented studentsborn into wealthy, distinguished families{\i0}

22
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,220
{\an8}How do you do?

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,930
{\i1}and shouldering the futureattend the school.{\i0}

24
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,510
{\an8}How do you do?

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,850
{\i1}Naturally ordinary people wouldn't be permittedto lead and bring these students together!{\i0}

26
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,610
Everyone, look!

27
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,610
The Student Council members!

28
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,200
{\i1}Kaguya Shinomiya, the vice-presidentof the Student Council at Shuchiin Academy.{\i0}

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,860
{\i1}Total assets: 200 trillion yen.{\i0}

30
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,410
{\i1}Her family owns the Shinomiya Group,{\i0}

31
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,790
{\i1}one of the top four financial conglomeratesin Japan, with over 1,000 subsidiaries.{\i0}

32
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,500
{\an8}SHINOMIYA BANK

33
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,710
{\i1}Befitting her superior lineage,she's a talented young woman{\i0}

34
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,250
{\i1}who has attainedsplendid achievements in various fields,{\i0}

35
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,050
{\i1}such as traditional performing arts,music, and martial arts.{\i0}

36
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,420
{\i1}That is Kaguya Shinomiya.{\i0}

37
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,470
{\i1}And the young man Shinomiya supports is...{\i0}

38
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,640
{\i1}Miyuki Shirogane, the presidentof the Student Council at Shuchiin Academy.{\i0}

39
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,940
{\i1}He's wise and intelligent,strong and silent.{\i0}

40
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,770
{\i1}He scores first placein the practice exams.{\i0}

41
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,520
{\i1}In contrast to talented Kaguya,{\i0}

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,400
{\i1}his devotion to studyingcommands awe and fear,{\i0}

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,690
{\i1}and because of that exemplary behavior,{\i0}

44
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,410
{\an8}PRESIDENT OF STUDENT COUNCIL

45
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,240
{\i1}he was selected to bethe Student Council president,{\i0}

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,990
{\i1}despite being relatively new to the school.{\i0}

47
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,740
{\i1}The weight of a solid gold braided cordhas been passed down{\i0}

48
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,410
{\i1}from president to presidentat Shuchiin Academy for 200 years!{\i0}

49
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,170
Those two always look so good together.

50
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,920
There's even a dignity to them!

51
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,880
Do you think they're dating?

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,180
- Somebody, please ask them!- I wouldn't dare!

53
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,340
{\an9}STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM

54
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,720
It would be presumptuous to even get closeto them, let alone ask such a question!

55
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,700
{\an8}It seems...

56
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,160
{\an1}I WILL MAKE YOUINVITE ME TO A MOVIE

57
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,120
{\an8}there's a rumor going around...

58
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,080
{\an8}that we're in a relationship or some such.

59
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,700
{\an8}That's normal for their age.

60
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,830
{\an8}You should ignore it.

61
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,330
That's all it is?

62
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,590
{\i1}They think Shinomiya and I are dating?{\i0}

63
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,340
{\i1}The fools certainly do enjoytalking about nonsensical love affairs.{\i0}

64
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,720
{\i1}Although...{\i0}

65
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,730
{\i1}if Shinomiya demanded that I go out with her,I suppose I would mull it over!{\i0}

66
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,810
{\i1}And I'm certain she has feelings for me.{\i0}

67
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,570
{\i1}Probably just a matter of time.{\i0}

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,900
{\i1}She should just take off the maskof a perfect, pampered young lady{\i0}

69
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,570
{\an8}{\i1}Shirogane, I need to talk to you.{\i0}

70
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,610
{\i1}and make her blushing appeal to me.{\i0}

71
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,950
{\i1}The ignorant children with their common talk.{\i0}

72
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,580
{\i1}Who do they think I am?{\i0}

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,120
{\i1}I'm a member of the Shinomiya family,the heart of this country.{\i0}

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,590
{\i1}How did they reach the conclusionthat I would be dating a commoner?{\i0}

75
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,970
{\i1}Well, I suppose there could bea very slight possibility.{\i0}

76
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,770
{\i1}If he got on his knees and offered uphis body, soul, and hometown,{\i0}

77
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,730
{\i1}I suppose I could train himto be a man who measures up to me.{\i0}

78
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,690
{\i1}Certainly, there's no manwho doesn't pine for me.{\i0}

79
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,730
{\i1}It's probably just a matter of time.{\i0}

80
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,240
{\i1}While they were engagingin this kind of thing...{\i0}

81
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,700
{\i1}half a year passed!{\i0}

82
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,420
{\i1}Nothing of note happened during that period.{\i0}

83
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,340
By the way, today there were snails

84
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,050
in the interior of the apple and cherry reliefin the courtyard's water fountain.

85
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,310
My younger sister once caught a coldtaking a dip in the water fountain,

86
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,640
even though it was hot outside.

87
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,310
When you act according to emotions,nothing good results.

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
{\an8}{\i1}During this period of nothingness,{\i0}

89
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,900
{\an8}{\i1}their thoughts shifted from,"I wouldn't mind dating him/her"{\i0}

90
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,820
{\an8}{\i1}to "Maybe I'll make him/herconfess his/her love to me."{\i0}

91
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,660
{\an8}{\i1}Meanwhile, one other person had no ideathat two super high school-level minds{\i0}

92
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,700
{\an1}STEAMED BUN

93
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,870
{\i1}were engaged in sophisticated strategizing!{\i0}

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,660
{\an8}SHUCHIIN ACADEMYSTUDENT COUNCIL SECRETARY

95
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,660
That reminds me! Listen to this!

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,660
CHIKA FUJIWARA

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,670
{\an8}I won a pair of movie tickets, butmy parents won't let me see stuff like that,

98
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,420

{\an7}LOVE REFRAIN

100
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,180
So are you two interested?

101
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,930
{\an8}NOTE: CHEAPSKATE

102
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,930
Hmm.

103
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,680
Come to think of it,I have a rare free weekend.

104
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,720
So, Shinomiya, why don't we—

105
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,770
Supposedly there's a jinx.If a boy and a girl

106
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,440
go see this movie together,they'll become a couple.

107
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,690
How romantic!

108
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,650
Oh, Shirogane.

109
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,940
Did you just invite me?

110
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,950
You want to go with me to a moviein which males and females

111
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,040
are said to become a coupleif they see it together.

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,410
Oh, dear, that sounds a lot like...

113
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,710
{\i1}Like I'm asking her out on a date!{\i0}

114
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,840
{\i1}Shirogane's predicament was,in romance,{\i0}

115
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,920
{\i1}"The person who falls in love loses"is the rule!{\i0}

116
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,590
{\i1}As they were both full of pride, neither onecould confess one iota of romantic interest!{\i0}

117
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,100
{\an8}{\i1}What should I do? It's blatant.The only thing I can do is smooth it over!{\i0}

118
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,600
Why don't we sell the tickets to a scalper?

119
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,860
Oh, Shirogane,I've never seen you this flustered before.

120
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,570
It's cute.

121
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,120
{\i1}This is unacceptable! There is no escape routeon the path that Shirogane conquers!{\i0}

122
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,420
{\i1}You're the onewho's going to run, Shinomiya!{\i0}

123
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,750
Yeah, I invited you, Shinomiya.

124
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,760
I don't care about rumors like that,but it seems you do.

125
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,850
Do you want to see this movie with me?

126
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,760
{\an9}LOVE REFRAIN

127
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,760
{\i1}That moment, Shinomiya thought...{\i0}

128
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,350
{\i1}After indicating the intent to invite me,{\i0}

129
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,770
{\i1}he assigned me the choiceof whether we see the movie or not.{\i0}

130
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,650
{\i1}Well played.{\i0}

131
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,440
{\an8}{\i1}I could choose to refuse,{\i0}

132
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,030
{\an8}{\i1}but then all of my preliminary arrangementsup to now would become meaningless.{\i0}

133
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,530
{\an8}WINNER

134
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,330
{\i1}I went to all the trouble of fabricating a prizeand putting it in Chika's mailbox.{\i0}

135
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,540
All right!

136
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:46,000
{\i1}My plan to aim for one of Shirogane'srare free days would be for nothing!{\i0}

137
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,550
{\an9}LOVE REFRAIN

138
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,550
{\i1}And if I turn him down now,{\i0}

139
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,800
{\i1}Shirogane may never invite meto anything again!{\i0}

140
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,050
{\i1}From the viewpoint of a young lady, I say no!And I say no to that kind of choice!{\i0}

141
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,800
{\an9}LOVE REFRAIN

142
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,220
Yes, well...

143
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,560
I can't help believing in stories like that.

144
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,020
So if we are going,

145
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,440
I'd like you to at least invite mewith more passion.

146
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,450
{\an7}MISS INNOCENT

147

{\i1}"Miss Innocent" skill implemented!{\i0}

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,240
{\i1}It's a negotiating skill passed onfrom father to child in the Shinomiya family.{\i0}

149
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,790
{\i1}It's said this calculated expression and voiceeven make the gods' hearts beat faster.{\i0}

150
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,870
{\an8}{\i1}In truth, Shirogane's thoughtswere also in disarray.{\i0}

151
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,880
{\an8}Well, I guess it's the man's dutyto ask a woman out.

152
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,550
{\an8}{\i1}That thought crossed his mind!{\i0}

153
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,050
{\an8}{\i1}Of course, Shinomiya didn'tlet that chance go by!{\i0}

154
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,720
{\i1}She pursued without a moment's delay!{\i0}

155
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,930
{\an8}LOVE REFRAIN

156
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,510
I'm at the age where I'd like to trya little romance, too.

157
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,890
{\i1}This battle of thoughtsseemed to be like a chess problem.{\i0}

158
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,650
{\i1}Shinomiya cornered Shirogane, who searchedfor an opportunity to turn it around.{\i0}

159
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,610
{\i1}The brains of these prodigiesraced two steps ahead,{\i0}

160
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,860
{\i1}clashing with each other as wheelsturned faster than any ordinary mind!{\i0}

161
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,530
{\i1}Kaguya strengthened her defense.{\i0}

162
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,160
{\i1}Shirogane tried to break through!{\i0}

163
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,660
{\i1}They both constructed a theoryleading to a conclusion!{\i0}

164
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,330
{\an8}{\i1}The one who completed the theory firstwould be the winner!{\i0}

165
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,420
If you don't like love stories,you can also use the tickets...

166
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,880
to go see the movie,"The Birdie from Tottori."

167
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,880
“The Birdie...

168
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,380
...from Tottori”?

169
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,180
{\i1}Chaos theory.{\i0}

170
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,850
{\i1}Secretary Fujiwara's casual remark{\i0}

171
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,140
{\i1}added an element of chaosinto the theories that were all but completed!{\i0}

172
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:31,360
{\i1}It was only one element, but like the Big Bang,the chaos increased the possibilities.{\i0}

173
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,320
{\i1}In order to processthe vastly expanded choices,{\i0}

174
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,700
{\an8}Um, is something wrong?

175
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,910
{\i1}the wheels in their brains spun even faster,going beyond their limits!{\i0}

176
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,280
{\i1}As a result, their brainscraved a great deal of sugar!{\i0}

177
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
{\an8}SUGAR

178
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,290
{\i1}The only sugar in the Student Council officewas in a single steamed bun!{\i0}

179
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,420
{\i1}Thus, whoever obtained the steamed bunwould be the winner!{\i0}

180
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,090
{\an8}Afternoon classes are about to start.

181
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,010
Well, see you again after school.

182
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,600
{\i1}It was a sophisticatedromantic battle of the brains,{\i0}

183
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,230
{\i1}with the ingenuity and prideof these two geniuses on the line.{\i0}

184
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,980
TODAY'S BATTLE RESULT

185
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,980
BOTH SIDES DEFEATED

186
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,030
{\an8}{\i1}I repeat, it was a sophisticatedromantic battle of the brains,{\i0}

187
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,240
{\an8}{\i1}with the ingenuity and prideof these two geniuses on the line!{\i0}

188
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,500
Huh?

189
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,960
{\an3}KAGUYA WANTSTO BE STOPPED

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,500
{\an8}Oh.

191
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,960
{\an8}Oh dear, huh?

192
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,300
A love letter?

193
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,260
Yes.

194
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,140
He was very passionate,even asking me out to dinner.

195
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,010
In other words, he invited you out on a date?

196
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,770
{\i1}A love letter to Shinomiya?{\i0}

197
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,520
{\i1}Some men really are fools for love.{\i0}

198
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,940
{\i1}We're talking about Shinomiyawho usually passes the time looking at me.{\i0}

199
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,820
{\i1}Does this fellow know, next to me,any other male in the vicinity{\i0}

200
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,530
{\i1}would only registeras a talking weed?{\i0}

201
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,530
{\an5}MR. WEED

202
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,530
{\an8}{\i1}Hello!{\i0}

203
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,660
{\i1}There's no way Shinomiya would accept.{\i0}

204
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,280
Do you intend to go on the date?

205
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,580
Of course.

206
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,790
Crack!

207
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,830
{\i1}You've lost your mind, Shinomiya!{\i0}

208
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,540
{\i1}Blindly accepting an invitationfrom someone you've never met!{\i0}

209
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,340
He's someone who mustered the courageto write me an enthusiastic love letter.

210
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,630
I'm sure I'll fall for him.

211
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,550
{\i1}Ridiculous!{\i0}

212
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,590
{\i1}You think I'll just let this happen?{\i0}

213
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,890
{\i1}Somehow, I have to stop Shinomiya!{\i0}

214
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,850
{\an8}Don't go on a date with any man but me!

215
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,600
{\i1}What's that?{\i0}

216
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:35,100
{\i1}Oh, my. Do you find the prospect of anotherperson taking me away really that unpleasant?{\i0}

217
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,110
{\an8}{\i1}That's cute.{\i0}

218
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,030
{\an8}{\i1}This is as good as a confession of love!{\i0}

219
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,120
{\an8}{\i1}It's like I'm saying,"Shinomiya, I love you!"{\i0}

220
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,870
{\i1}I have to...{\i0}

221
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,120
{\i1}I have to avoid that at all costs!{\i0}

222
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,370
{\an8}Kaguya, are you really going?

223
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,120
{\an8}Yes.

224
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,750
I'm really looking forward to it.

225
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,460
{\i1}At first glance, it seems Kaguya is thinkingonly romantically, without any principles.{\i0}

226
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,340
{\i1}As if I would really go.{\i0}

227
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,630
{\i1}Flowers must be bloominginside that boy's brain.{\i0}

228
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,050
{\i1}Of course it's a bluff!{\i0}

229
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,760
{\i1}If he wants to invite me out on a date,he'd better start by offering me a country{\i0}

230
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,010
{\i1}and then be worthy of my consideration.{\i0}

231
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,480
{\i1}Like I would just go out with himas an act of charity?{\i0}

232
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,900
{\i1}Shinomiya had no intentionsof going on a date with a talking weed.{\i0}

233
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,400
{\an8}{\i1}After all, it was only a strategyto get Shirogane to stop her.{\i0}

234
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,240
{\i1}A romantic battle of the brains!{\i0}

235
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,530
{\i1}As they were both full of pride,neither one could confess romantic interest!{\i0}

236
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,990
{\i1}The only thing to dowas use resourcefulness and skill{\i0}

237
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,250
{\i1}to make the other personconfess their love!{\i0}

238
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,790
{\i1}Is there no way I can naturallykeep her from going? Think!{\i0}

239
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,000
{\i1}Intelligence put to the test!{\i0}

240
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,130
{\i1}It's pointless.Until Shirogane bows his head{\i0}

241
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,340
{\i1}and honestly begs me not to go,I refuse to cancel.{\i0}

242
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,510
{\i1}A clever scheme!{\i0}

243
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,430
{\i1}That's the romantic battle of the brains!{\i0}

244
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,760
{\i1}The ongoing duel between them!{\i0}

245
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,770
Shinomiya...

246
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,730
as the president of Student Council,

247
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,150
I can't endorseillicit activities with the opposite sex.

248
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,270
{\i1}The ace up his sleeve.{\i0}

249
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,360
{\i1}An ingenious approach.Giving his opinion not as himself,{\i0}

250
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,030
{\i1}but as the president of Student Council,doesn't do him any damage.{\i0}

251
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,530
That's an exaggeration.We're just going out for dinner.

252
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,780
Our teacher will be the judge of that.

253
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,540
Suspension from school is very possible.

254
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,040
If you insist on going, well...

255
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,790
{\an8}TATTLE TO THE TEACHER!

256
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,790
I'll run it by the teacher!

257
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,880
{\i1}Tattling to the teacher!{\i0}

258
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,420
{\i1}It's tremendously effective,but it's a risky choice,{\i0}

259
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,220
{\an8}{\i1}Naughty, naughty!We're gonna tell the teacher!{\i0}

260
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,220
{\i1}since the person who uses itis likely to be labeled a coward.{\i0}

261
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,230
{\i1}But for Shirogane, preventing Shinomiya'sdate was more important than his honor.{\i0}

262
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,390
{\i1}That determination had an effect on Kaguya.{\i0}

263
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,230
{\i1}I didn't think Shirogane would usea forbidden move like that.{\i0}

264
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,230
{\an8}GRRR...

265
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,230
{\i1}But I'm going to stick to my guns!{\i0}

266
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,230
I don't mind.

267
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,240
If it's true love,I'm prepared to even accept expulsion.

268
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,660
E-Expulsion?

269
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,370
I'm prepared to offer my body and soulfor true love.

270
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,830
{\i1}Body and soul?{\i0}

271
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,130
{\i1}Shirogane takes major damage!{\i0}

272
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,130
{\an8}Th...

273
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,090
That's ridiculous!

274
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,630
No, it's not!

275
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,340
He's conveyed his ardent love for me.

276
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,760
Wouldn't it be dishonorable of menot to be prepared for expulsion?

277
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,140
S-Stop being silly!

278
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,010
Then maybe I should confess my love!

279
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,020
For the sake of argument...

280
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,690
Just for argument,

281
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,690
{\an8}would you be able to forgetabout this boy then?

282
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,570
There...

283
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,950
There's a possibility.

284
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,250
Could something so easily swayedbe true love?

285
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,460
If being wooed by another mancan make you forget him,

286
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,380
then there's no way it's true love!

287
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,840
I just said there's a possibility!

288
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,930
{\an8}I see, I see. Then it's true love.

289
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,470
{\an8}{\i1}If you're worried about me, you shouldstop me without regard to the way it looks!{\i0}

290
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,480
I don't care what you say!I'm really going!

291
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,730
{\i1}Unless I get a tearfully passionateconfession of love, I really am going!{\i0}

292
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,230
{\i1}Shirogane?{\i0}

293
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,650
{\an7}TEARY-EYED

294
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,700
I don't want anyone to have you, Kaguya!

295
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,410
- I don't want you expelled!- Fujiwa...

296
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,790
{\an7}WAAH

297
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,000
No, no!

298
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,670
- Don't go away!- Hey...

299
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,790
I'm crazy about you!

300
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,210
- I love you!- Enough! I won't go, so get off of me!

301
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,050
{\i1}Kaguya lost today's battle.{\i0}

302
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,050
{\an8}TODAY'S BATTLE RESULT

303
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,050
{\an5}KAGUYA DEFEATED

304
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,260
{\an8}A PASSIONATE LOVE LETTER ARRIVED...

305
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,060
BY HAYASAKA

306
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
Forget it!

307
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,060
Why not? Just give me one bite!

308
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,820
All right, but jeez.

309
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,070
Here.

310
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,330
Improper!

311
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,540
{\an8}Worth getting that angry about?

312
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,830
KAGUYA WANTS IT

313
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,120
{\an8}They don't have enough self-awareness

314
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,330
{\an8}about being studentsof traditional Shuchiin Academy.

315
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,340
{\an8}Coaxing someone like that in public,it's despicable!

316
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,340
It's silly and vulgar!

317
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,170
That's a mean way to put it.

318
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,510
Shirogane, you broughtyour own lunch today?

319
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,100
Yeah. My grandpa in the countrysent us a lot of vegetables.

320
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,140
It may not look great,but I have confidence in the taste.

321
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,060
{\an8}{\i1}Miyuki, eat it all up!{\i0}

322
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,940
{\i1}It was the first timeKaguya had seen such a lunch.{\i0}

323
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,860
{\i1}Kaguya's own lunch was always preparedby a team of chefs{\i0}

324
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,200
{\i1}and delivered to herduring the lunch hour.{\i0}

325
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,240
{\i1}Her lunch was nutritionally balanced,of course,{\i0}

326
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,500
{\i1}achieving harmonywith fresh ingredients as the foundation.{\i0}

327
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,710
{\i1}That is the lunch that Kaguya knows.{\i0}

328
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,920
{\i1}Boiled food! Red wieners! Rolled omelette!{\i0}

329
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,380
{\i1}Hamburger! Pickled dried plum! And...{\i0}

330
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,220
{\an7}SEAWEED EGG

331
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,220
{\i1}seasoning over rice!{\i0}

332
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,550
{\i1}All the food one could wantcrammed into a box.{\i0}

333
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:03,270
{\i1}It struck Kaguya it was likethe freedom of a child's treasure chest.{\i0}

334
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,690
{\i1}Wieners sliced to looklike an octopus! They really exist!{\i0}

335
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,230
{\i1}I want to try one, but...{\i0}

336
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,230
{\i1}Kaguya's pride wouldn't allow it!{\i0}

337
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,230
{\an8}Lunch, lunch.

338
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,740
You brought lunch today?It looks delicious!

339
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,110
I know, right? I made it all myself.

340
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,660
Lucky. Please give me a bite!

341
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,500
Sure, I don't mind.

342
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,250
Really?

343
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,210
I'll give you this hamburger.

344
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,250
All right!

345
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,250
{\an8}{\i1}Hey! Chika?{\i0}

346
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,760
{\an8}DELICIOUS

347
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,760
{\i1}It's out of this world!{\i0}

348
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:45,020
The piping hot juice that spillsout of a hamburger is delicious,

349
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,940
but there's something specialabout a hamburger

350
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,770
that's yummy at room temperaturewith all of the flavor locked in!

351
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,020
{\an5}FLAVOR

352
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,020
{\an5}YUMMY

353
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,020
{\an9}MEAT JUICES LOCKED IN

354
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,440
- All right, eat this, too.- Yay!

355
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,900
{\i1}Chika...{\i0}

356
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,410
{\i1}I considered you a friend...{\i0}

357
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,080
{\i1}but if your life was in danger tomorrow,I wouldn't lift a finger to help you.{\i0}

358
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,540
{\i1}What's that scornful stare about?{\i0}

359
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,290
You...

360
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,380
{\i1}You think my lunch is that miserable?{\i0}

361
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,630
{\i1}Make fun of me?{\i0}

362
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,260
{\i1}I'll teach you a lesson!{\i0}

363
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,390
Hot miso soup!

364
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,770
It's no good if the rice gets cold and hard,but if you have it with miso soup...

365
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,270
in that instant,the two merge into a supreme dish.

366
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Try it.

367
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,770
Sure!

368
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,490
{\i1}Hey! Why did you take itfrom the part he already ate from?{\i0}

369
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,780
{\i1}That's an indirect kiss!{\i0}

370
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,240
{\i1}That, too?{\i0}

371
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,790
The rice! The rice is melting in my mouth!

372
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,880
Yes, just as using cold ricefor cooked rice with green tea

373
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:58,800
{\an9}FROZEN RICE

374
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,800
{\an9}DOESN'T STICK TOGETHER

375
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,420
has been traditional for ages,

376
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,800
{\an6}MIX IT WITH SOUP

377
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,800
there's marvelous compatibilitybetween warm soup and a cold lunch.

378
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,800
{\an6}BREAKS APART

379
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,800
{\an4}DELICIOUS!!

380
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,550
This is delicious!You're a genius, Shirogane!

381
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,550
Okay, enough praise!

382
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,550
{\an8}{\i1}How about that, Shinomiya?{\i0}

383
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,930
{\an8}After all, this isn't secondhand knowledge!

384
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,720
{\i1}I bet you didn't knowhow good cold rice could be.{\i0}

385
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,140
{\an8}It's a discovery basedon experimentation and inspiration!

386
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,560
{\i1}Kaguya! Kaguya! Kaguya! Kaguya!{\i0}

387
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,560
{\an8}He's on the level of Newton,maybe even higher!

388
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,820
{\i1}Kaguya, let's go home together!{\i0}

389
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,490
{\i1}I love getting to do a sleepover with you!{\i0}

390
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,070
{\i1}It doesn't hurt, but I'm crying!{\i0}

391
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,580
{\i1}Goodbye, Chika. We're no longer friends.{\i0}

392
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,080
{\i1}She looks even more contemptuous!{\i0}

393
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,790
{\i1}But why?{\i0}

394
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,210
{\i1}I see. If that's how you want to play it,then I have an idea, too.{\i0}

395
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,130
{\i1}Just wait until tomorrow.{\i0}

396
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,470
{\an8}THE NEXT DAY

397
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,600
A lot of effort was put into this.

398
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,100
I just got bitten by the cooking bug.

399
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,900
Huh. It actually looks good.

400
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,320
{\i1}I know it!Then you're going to ask me, aren't you?{\i0}

401
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,990
{\i1}Ask me for a bite.{\i0}

402
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,990
{\i1}Then I'll be magnanimous, and...{\i0}

403
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,660
Gimme! Gimme!

404
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,410
Good grief. Fine, Shirogane,we can exchange lunches.

405
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,000
{\i1}And that's how I'll accept it.{\i0}

406
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,500
{\i1}So come over anytime.{\i0}

407
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,800
Why don't we eat, too?

408
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,050
Yeah!

409
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,800
Octopus-shaped wieners again today!

410
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,760
Yep. They're a staple.

411
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,470
Nice! They're cute and yummy!Nothing could be better!

412
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,980
I don't know about that.

413
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,400
Why not? That's how I think of them!

414
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
All right, all ri...

415
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,030
Shirogane...

416
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,820
I recall you love oysters.

417
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,120
{\an8}{\i1}What is this disturbing aurashe's been giving off since yesterday?{\i0}

418
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,290
{\an8}{\i1}Why is she offering mea meaninglessly high-class dish?{\i0}

419
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,830
{\i1}She must be plotting something.Otherwise...{\i0}

420
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,790
Oh, my.

421
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,040
That's a cute lunch.

422
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,840
{\i1}I'll give you this out of charity, Shirogane,since I feel sorry for you.{\i0}

423
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,550
{\i1}She feels sorry for me?{\i0}

424
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,720
{\i1}Th-This is humiliating!{\i0}

425
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,430
{\i1}I can't take it.{\i0}

426
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,180
{\i1}I will not take it!{\i0}

427
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,640
I have nothing to give youin exchange for this high-class dish!

428
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,560
{\i1}I'd be happy with octopus wieners!{\i0}

429
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,230
Kaguya? Doesn't that hurt?

430
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,060
Is your head okay?

431
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,610
{\i1}Darn it! That sounds like an insult!{\i0}

432
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,610
Anyway, what is that?

433
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:31,370
Oh, this?Shirogane made lunch for me, too.

434
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,200
There's no differencein making it for one or two people.

435
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,080
It's delicious!

436
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,330
Really? Good to hear.

437
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,590
Color is important to a lunch box, right?

438
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,880
{\an8}That's certainly true.

439
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,630
{\i1}Cattle in human form.{\i0}

440
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,720
{\i1}Prideless parasite,relying on someone else to survive.{\i0}

441
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,300
{\i1}All that nutrition to your chest,nothing for your brain!{\i0}

442
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,850
{\i1}Repulsive creature!{\i0}

443
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,850
{\an8}{\i1}I swear I'll never forgive you.{\i0}

444
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,350
{\i1}Shinomiya's eyes are like an assassin's!{\i0}

445
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,690
Crap! I have the club meeting today!I'd better hurry and eat!

446
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,730
{\an8}{\i1}My octopus-shaped wiener!{\i0}

447
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,110
I'll see you later!

448
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,240
{\i1}What am I doing?{\i0}

449
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,870
{\an8}{\i1}I feel like a fool.{\i0}

450
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,000
{\an8}Kaguya...

451
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,510
It's good, right?

452
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,430
Let's share it!

453
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,190
Chika...

454
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,770
I'm sorry.

455
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,770
I had the wrong idea about you.

456
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,980
You're definitely a human being.

457
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,400
What did you think I was before?

458
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,160
Have confidence.

459
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:59,410
{\an5}TODAY'S BATTLE RESULT

460
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,740
{\an8}{\i1}Today's battle.{\i0}

461
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,490
I've never lacked confidence about that!

462
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:59,410
{\an8}DUE TO SHIROGANE'S ESCAPING,VICTORY FOR KAGUYA

463
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
{\i1}Kaguya won.{\i0}

464
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,170
Good grief.

465
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,550
What a nuisance Shirogane is.

466
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,760
{\an8}After all that preparation,he still hasn't confessed his love to me.

467
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,680
{\an8}Kaguya...

468
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,140
{\an8}purely hypothetically,if you truly fall in love someday,

469
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,850
{\an8}would you wait for that personto confess their love, like now?

470
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,440
{\an8}Or would you confess your love?

471
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,650
{\an8}{\i1}The romantic battle of the brains.{\i0}

472
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,440
{\an8}{\i1}It's a duel between two souls,with their dignity on the line!{\i0}

473
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,570
{\an8}If that time comes, I would considerthe risk of someone stealing him first

474
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,450
{\an8}and come to the onerational conclusion.

475
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,200
{\an8}Of course I would go.

476
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,250
{\an8}I would go.

477
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,790
{\an8}{\i1}Please.{\i0}

478
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,710
{\an8}Of course I... Of course.

479
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,460
{\an8}{\i1}Please understand that she's nothaving trouble because of a silly reason{\i0}

480
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,630
{\an8}{\i1}like "Confessing my lovewould be too embarrassing"{\i0}

481
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,970
{\an8}{\i1}or "What if he turned me down?"{\i0}

482
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,470
CONFESSION

483
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,060
{\an8}Who cares? It doesn't even matter!
