1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,860
{\i1}The treasurer of the four-memberstudent council at Shuchiin Academy...{\i0}

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,230
{\i1}Yu Ishigami.{\i0}

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,580
{\i1}The man who is indispensableto the student council,{\i0}

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,200
{\i1}yet hasn't mademuch of an impression on them.{\i0}

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,080
{\i1}The man Shirogane,the president of the student council,{\i0}

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,960
{\i1}chose to be the treasurerbased on expectations of his prowess.{\i0}

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,000
Here's this month's financial report.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,750
Great.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,630
{\i1}He has been biding his time...{\i0}

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,630
What is it?

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,760
I want to quit the student council.

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,020
{\i1}...waiting for the chanceto resign from the student council!{\i0}

13
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,480
I see. Quit the student council...

14
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,240
YU ISHIGAMI WANTS TO LIVE

15
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,240
{\an8}You've got to be kidding me!Without you, we'll go bankrupt!

16
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,740
{\an8}I'm begging you here!

17
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,740
{\an8}{\i1}Yu Ishigami.{\i0}

18
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,580
{\i1}He's a data processing expert.{\i0}

19
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,370
{\i1}At Shuchiin Academy,only the president is elected.{\i0}

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,120
{\an7}PRESIDENTMIYUKI SHIROGANE

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,620
{\an9}VICE-PRESIDENTKAGUYA SHINOMIYA

22
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,750
{\an7}SECRETARYCHIKA FUJIWARA

23
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,750
{\an9}TREASURERYU ISHIGAMI

24
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,250
{\i1}The other members are appointedbased on their abilities.{\i0}

25
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,460
{\i1}Yu Ishigami is a talented personwho was scouted by the student council...{\i0}

26
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,760
{\i1}despite the fact that he had barely begunhis first year there.{\i0}

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,390
{\i1}Normally he takes his work home{\i0}

28
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,600
{\i1}and only shows upin the student council room for meetings,{\i0}

29
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,680
{\i1}but he is a full-fledged council member.{\i0}

30
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,440
{\i1}Undeniably, Yu Ishigami is the treasurerof Shuchiin Academy's student council.{\i0}

31
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,860
{\i1}And now he is trying to quit his post.{\i0}

32
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,280
{\an8}But I've got an important reason.

33
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,030
{\i1}That reason is...{\i0}

34
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,030
{\an8}What reason?

35
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,910
{\an8}I think I'm going to be murdered.

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,950
Murdered?

37
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,790
I think Shinomiya-senpaiis going to kill me.

38
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,160
{\an8}Shino...

39
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,160
O-On what basis do you think that?

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,920
{\an8}Her eyes.

41
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,670
{\an8}Eyes?

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,130
{\i1}People's eyes are organsthat are connected directly to the brain.{\i0}

43
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,420
{\i1}Normally half of the brainis used to process the sense of sight.{\i0}

44
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,510
{\i1}The movement of eyes can showwhat someone is cautious about or hungry for.{\i0}

45
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,560
{\i1}Those organs clearly revealthe brain's activity.{\i0}

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,560
{\an9}FOOD > CATGLUTTON

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,560
{\an7}DOG > FOODSCAREDY-CAT

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,940
{\an8}I can tell five or six percent of a person'strue character just by looking into their eyes.

49
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,610
That's not much!

50
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,980
I can probably do the same!

51
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,700
The way Shinomiya-senpailooks at me sometimes...

52
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,370
I'm positive that the intent to killis in that glance.

53
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,700
What exactly happened?

54
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,000
{\an8}It was a month ago.

55
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,590
{\an4}COFFEE BLENDFREE TICKET

56
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,550
But a lot of people thinkthat's the best way to kill time.

57
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,720
{\i1}What is this?{\i0}

58
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,350
I don't really go to coffee shops.

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,640
They're too expensive for my blood.

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,730
You have a point.

61
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,730
If there was a coupon or something,it would be different.

62
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,990
{\an8}PAT PAT

63
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,990
Yeah.

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,990
If it were cheaper,I wouldn't mind going once in a while.

65
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,460
Not a word to anyone about those tickets.

66
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,460
{\i1}What happened?{\i0}

67
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,590
She threatened me, so I can't tell you.

68
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,630
Threatened?

69
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,890
I have a feelingshe's killed two or three people already.

70
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,970
What happened?

71
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,390
{\an8}And then last week, too...

72
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,690
{\i1}Shinomiya-senpai,are you in love with the president?{\i0}

73
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,980
{\an8}FSSST

74
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,780
{\i1}In love with the president?{\i0}

75
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,320
{\i1}Don't talk nonsense!That would never happen!{\i0}

76
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,070
{\i1}You don't see him as a love interest?{\i0}

77
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,080
{\i1}N-No!{\i0}

78
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,410
{\i1}Of course not.{\i0}

79
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,200
{\i1}Really?{\i0}

80
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,170
{\i1}In fact, rumors like that are a nuisance!{\i0}

81
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,920
{\i1}Is that right?{\i0}

82
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,670
{\i1}I thought they'd make a good couple.{\i0}

83
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,220
{\i1}Then I'll give the president a hintthat you have no romantic interest.{\i0}

84
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,940
{\an9}YANK YANK

85
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,520
{\i1}You'll tell him no such thing!{\i0}

86
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,940
{\i1}You hear me?{\i0}

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,690
I think she has the skillsof a trained assassin.

88
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,940
A trained assassin?

89
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,490
Using the corner of a couchto strangle me... That's a pro!

90
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,820
What do you think Shinomiya is?

91
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:56,080
{\an8}SHIVER SHIVER

92
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,080
My guess is she's a natural-born serial killer.

93
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,950
I can see it in her eyes.

94
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,080
You put too much faithin that five or six percent!

95
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,460
Fujiwara-senpai'sin even more danger than me.

96
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,500
Sometimes Shinomiya-senpai staresat her as if she's less than human.

97
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,010
I estimate she's gotanother two months left.

98
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,630
You calculated her life expectancy?

99
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,590
Ridiculous!

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,720
No, that typeis the most dangerous predator.

101
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,100
President...

102
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,100
Is Ishigami here?

103
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,730
I was at a meeting.

104
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,860
Don't make it worse for yourself!

105
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,860
It was about the budgetfor the drama club.

106
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,690
Turn yourself in, Shinomiya!

107
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,150
{\an8}Please!

108
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,360
Listen when someone's talking to you!

109
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,620
{\an4}BEND BEND

110
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,830
I told you I was helpingthe drama club, remember?

111
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,210
Today was the costume fitting.

112
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,880
O-Oh.

113
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,130
Still, you didn't needto bring that prop in here.

114
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,380
Um, I just wantedto tease you a little with it.

115
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,010
Sorry.

116
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,470
{\i1}Cute.{\i0}

117
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,350
Shirogane-senpai, this is a trap.

118
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,520
She's playing it cuteso you'll let your guard down.

119
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,610
D-Don't scare me like that!

120
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,900
That's just a costume!Shinomiya hasn't killed anyone!

121
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,110
President!

122
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,780
Help.

123
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,330
Miss Kaguya killed me!

124
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Then it's true!

125
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,790
What's true?She's just wearing special makeup!

126
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,340
Oh, right!

127
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,090
No, President. This is a trap, too.

128
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,090
I suspect she really is dead,

129
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,010
but Shinomiya-senpai performedsome mad-science surgery on her.

130
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,600
Ishigami...

131
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,350
You always let imaginationget the better of you.

132
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,600
Shinomiya would never murder a soul.

133
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,230
{\an8}Try to have more faith in your colleagues.

134
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,610
{\an8}Okay?

135
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,610
{\an8}Faith in my colleagues...

136
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,530
Anyway, that's impressive.

137
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,610
I know, right?

138
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,370
How is that attached?

139
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,740
It's like this. See?

140
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,330
Sorry I asked.

141
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,290
Faith in my colleagues...

142
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,830
Ishigami...

143
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,500
About our secret...

144
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,590
I appreciate that you've kept it to yourself.

145
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,140
Being tight-lipped is a virtue, right?

146
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,640
If you had blabbed...

147
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,230
{\an8}Faith!

148
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,190
STAB

149
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,400
...this wouldn't be a toy.

150
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,280
Also, don't put the president in a bind.

151
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,610
Please don't sayanything more about resigning.

152
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,700
Do you want to trystabbing me, President?

153
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,830
{\an8}{\i1}Then was she...{\i0}

154
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,160
Can I? I wanted to try it once.

155
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,540
{\i1}listening the whole time?{\i0}

156
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,930
{\an8}RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:ISHIGAMI LOSES

157
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
{\i1}Results of today's match...{\i0}

158

{\an8}CAGE FOR CATS

162
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,690
There's an animal cage in front of you.

163
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,690
How many cats are in the cage?

164
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,820
{\an8}What kind of abstract question is that?

165
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,780
{\an1}CHIKA FUJIWARAWANTS TO TEST YOU

166
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,150
{\an8}It's a psychological test!

167
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,530
{\an8}It's from a bookI borrowed from the library.

168
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,740
Just by answering this question,

169
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,450
I'll be able to understandthe depths of your mind, President.

170
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,290
That's silly.

171
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,420
As if you could understand the workingsof the mind with a question like that.

172
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,420
Come on, just humor me.

173
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,300
How many cats?

174
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,260
I guess about nine cats.

175
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,800
{\an8}That tells mehow many children you want!

176
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,810
{\an8}{\i1}That's exactly right!{\i0}

177
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,560
Nine kids? That's like a baseball team!

178
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,560
{\an8}{\i1}Nine kids? That many?{\i0}

{\an8}PSYCHOLOGY TEST

180
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,560
{\i1}Psychology tests.{\i0}

181
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,690
{\i1}Abstract questions that draw outwhat someone really thinks.{\i0}

182
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,070
{\an8}{\i1}Most of them have amusing game elementsthat employ the Barnum effect,{\i0}

183
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,610
{\an8}{\i1}but some of them are practicaland based on actual psychology.{\i0}

184
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,490
{\i1}The person who thinks of these testsonly as an amusing trifle{\i0}

185
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,580
{\i1}and lets their guard downmay be in for a bitter experience.{\i0}

186
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,210
{\an8}I've got another really interesting one!

187
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,130
Let's do it together!

188
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,550
Oh, us, too?

189
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,340
Yes!

190
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,720
Are you ready?

191
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,090
"You're walking down a dark path.

192
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,220
Suddenly, someone taps youon the shoulder from behind.

193
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,430
Who is that person?"

194
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,140
Give me a hint.

195
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,900
This isn't a quiz,so it doesn't work that way.

196
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,730
Oh.

197
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,110
A dark path...

198
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,940
What could this be getting at?

199
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,030
{\i1}There it is!The second question on page 47!{\i0}

200
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,240
{\i1}That answer...{\i0}

201
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,740
{\an8}THAT'S THE PERSON YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH!!

202
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,740
{\i1}indicates whom you're in love with!{\i0}

203
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,080
{\an8}{\i1}If you say the nameof someone of the opposite sex{\i0}

204
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,500
{\an8}{\i1}it's like a confession of love!{\i0}

205
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,250
{\i1}As is often the case,Kaguya had prepared for this situation.{\i0}

{\i1}and is especially familiarwith her behavioral patterns.{\i0}

{\i1}she predicted a high likelihood of Fujiwarabringing it to the student council room.{\i0}

{\an8}{\i1}She's able to avoid any dangerous answers.{\i0}

218
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,030
What do you do with it then?"

219
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,490
Let's see. I would makedelicious food for it every day...

220
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,950
and give it a massagebefore it went to sleep.

221
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,620
The answer is...

222
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,200
"After you get married,what will you do for your spouse?"

223

{\i1}In other words,{\i0}

225
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,460
{\i1}she holds a huge advantage.{\i0}

226
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,210
Let me think.It would be you, Miss Fujiwara.

{\an8}{\i1}Why are you running away, Ishigami?{\i0}

231
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,860
My answer is Shinomiya-senpai.

232
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,030
Me?

233
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,200
{\i1}That's how Ishigami feels?{\i0}

{\i1}Ishigami is rejected.{\i0}

{\i1}Now the president is the real issue.{\i0}

238
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,720
{\i1}I hate dark, scary places.{\i0}

239
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,680
{\an8}{\i1}President, let's go home together.{\i0}

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,180
Well, I—

241
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,100
Grin!

242
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,360
{\i1}Wait! Why is Fujiwaragrinning at me like that?{\i0}

243
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,360
{\an7}GRIN GRIN

244
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,900
{\an8}{\i1}She called it "really interesting."{\i0}

245
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,280
{\an8}{\i1}A questionthat love-obsessed girl pounced on...{\i0}

246
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,410
{\an8}{\i1}This one is definitely not a harmless test!{\i0}

247
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,160
{\an8}{\i1}If the answer is"The person you're in love with..."{\i0}

248
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,580
{\i1}Oh, President...{\i0}

249
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,870
{\i1}So, you're subconsciouslyin love with me?{\i0}

250
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,330
{\i1}How cute.{\i0}

251
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,250
{\i1}It would be like a confession of love!{\i0}

252
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,470
{\i1}The best answer would be someone they'd besatisfied with, but nobody in this room!{\i0}

253
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,760
{\i1}Then...{\i0}

254
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,510
I guess my little sister.

255
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,890
"The person who taps you on the shoulderindicates the person you're in love with."

256
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,520
In short, the presidenthas a sister complex.

257
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,360
That's the most boring answer.

258
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,530
That's right. I have a sister complex.

259
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,780
{\i1}I'm in love with Shinomiya-senpai?{\i0}

260
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,620
{\i1}No, I think this emotion is terror!{\i0}

261
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,540
President, I think I haveStockholm syndrome, so I'm going home.

262
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,550
A-All right. Get well soon.

263
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,180
It could also bethe suspension bridge effect.

264
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,430
I'll go to a hospital on the way home.

265
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,600
I wanna try answering one myself,so I'll look on the net.

266
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,190
{\i1}Shoot! Miss Fujiwara is lookingfor a question outside of the book!{\i0}

267
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,520
This one's cute!

268
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,400
"You're in a field of flowers.

269
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,360
{\an8}The owner said you can take homeas many flowers as you like.

270
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,570
{\an8}How many will you take home?"

271
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,280
{\an8}{\i1}A question she doesn't know the answer to!{\i0}

272
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,040
{\an8}Flowers, huh?

273
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,120
{\an8}I'd carefully pick only the prettiest ones.

274
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,380
{\an8}So just a couple.

275
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:27,170
I-I suppose I'd take enoughto make a lovely bouquet.

276
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,760
{\an8}I see.

277
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,850
{\an8}{\i1}What should I do?I answered honestly without thinking!{\i0}

278
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
How many for you, President?

279
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,350
{\i1}Well, unlike that last one,I don't have to say a name,{\i0}

280
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,850
{\i1}so I can answer it normally.{\i0}

281
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,650
I can take as many as I likefor free, right?

282
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,690
Then there's only one possible answer.

283
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:51,200
{\an7}HEAP

284
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,990
I'd take as manyas I could cram into a truck!

285
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,200
Maybe even a truck wouldn't be enough.

286
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,450
{\an8}That's a poor person's mentality.

287
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,580
What would you dowith all of those flowers?

288
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,710
Well, I could give some awayand sell some, right?

289
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,210
{\an8}{\i1}Um, the answer is...{\i0}

CLICK HERE FOR THE ANSWER

291
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,710
{\an1}THE AMOUNT OF FLOWERS YOU TOOK INDICATESHOW MUCH LOVE YOU HAVE FOR A SPECIAL SOMEONE!

292
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,180
What was the answer?

293
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,100
Nothing. Um, "How muchyou love flowers" or something.

294
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,060
Yes, that's what it was.

295
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,190
Even though I love flowers?

296
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,610
{\an8}Silly.

297
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,860
I don't agree with that one!

298
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,900
Neither do I.

299
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,160
But that's what the answer was.We just have to accept it.

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,250
- I'm gonna get celery!- What kind should I get?

310
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,220
I'm totally sorry.

311
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,010
I'm working again today.I have to go straight there.

312
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,430
Again?

313
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,930
You work too much.

314
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,060
Next time, definitely!

315
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,060
Yeah, okay!

316
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,770
It's time to go home, Lady Kaguya.

317
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,280
Hayasaka, I told you not to cometo the student council room.

318
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,410
{\an8}I've confirmed that the presidentand the other members have already left.

319
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,490
{\an1}KAGUYA WANTSTO BE NOTICED

320
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,660
{\an8}Rest assured.

321
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,370
{\an8}Carelessness like that can be fatal.

322
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,040
{\an8}Recently, you've become lax, haven't you?

323
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,250
Between your appearance,those nails,

324
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,090
{\an7}UNBUTTONEDHERCOLLAR

325
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,750
NAILS

326
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,840
{\an4}MYSTERIOUSKEYCHAIN

327
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,840
and your skirt length,you're likely violating school rules.

328
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,840
ROLLED UP HER SKIRT

329
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,800
It's all within the boundsof school regulations.

330
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,220
Although you could sayI'm bending the rules a bit.

331
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,800
A bit.

332
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,010
For us, beauty is power.

333
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,810
{\an8}BEAUTY IS LIVE AMMO

334
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,520
{\an8}High society is not for peoplewithout adornment.

335
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,820
{\an8}You don't want opportunities stolen by womenwith only good looks going for them.

336
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,690
{\an8}I would say you're too stuffy about it,Lady Kaguya.

337
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,030
Lately, lightly polished nailsare even in style here.

338
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,330
If you want men to think you're cute,you should take an interest.

339
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,210
Really? Then will the president...

340
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,580
I mean, will boys think I'm cute?

341
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,340
After all this time, I'm surprisedyou haven't given yourself away.

342
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,340
But, yes, of course.

343
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,340
{\i1}Hayasaka realized that nails had little to dowith popularity amongst the opposite sex.{\i0}

344
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,930
Boys will...

345
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,970
{\an8}Come on. Let's go home and paint your nails.

346
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,650
{\i1}But she gave only vague answersin her desire to give Kaguya some glam.{\i0}

347
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,850
{\an8}Are you sure about this?

348
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,020
{\an8}It's okay.

349
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,650
{\an8}What's okay? Hey!

350
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,230
{\an6}THE NEXT DAY

351
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,240
{\i1}Gel nails which don't infringeon the school dress code.{\i0}

352
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,070
{\i1}The modesty of rhinestone onlyon each ring finger was part of the appeal.{\i0}

353
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
{\i1}I wonder what the president will think.{\i0}

354
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,750
{\i1}Will he think it's cute?{\i0}

355
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,000
{\i1}Or maybe he'll think it's frivolous.{\i0}

356
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,170
{\i1}What's the nail polish about?{\i0}

357
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,920
{\i1}I know.{\i0}

358
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,600
{\i1}I don't want it in that case.{\i0}

359
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,640
{\an8}{\i1}I'll just go home today, and...{\i0}

360
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,890
{\an8}What are you doing, Shinomiya?

361
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,900
Aren't you going in?

362
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,860
Well, I was on my way in!

363
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,780
Miss Kaguya!

364
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,070
About this part...

365
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,660
Yes, what is it?

366
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,910
Are you hiding something behind you?

367
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,120
No, nothing.

368
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,210
{\an8}{\i1}The only times she's quick on the uptakeare situations like this!{\i0}

369
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,760
{\an8}{\i1}If someone's going to notice,I want it to be the president.{\i0}

370
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,550
{\an8}{\i1}Certainly not her!{\i0}

371
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,260
{\i1}I have to get closer.{\i0}

372
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,850
Here, President.The minutes from our last meeting.

373
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,560
Oh, thanks.

374
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Stare.

375
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,820
{\an8}And there's an error here.

376
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,940
{\an8}You're right.

377
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,700
{\an8}Indeed.

378
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,950
Good eye!

379
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,450
{\i1}He didn't notice!{\i0}

380
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,200
{\an8}{\i1}Shinomiya is being fashionable!{\i0}

381
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
{\an8}{\i1}Jeez, why?{\i0}

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,210
{\an8}{\i1}Is it because you're not interested in me?{\i0}

383
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,250
{\i1}What caused the change?{\i0}

384
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,720
{\i1}She's always avoided ornamentation,saying, "Does a swan dress up?"{\i0}

385
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,720
{\an8}{\i1}What should I do?Should I mention it?{\i0}

386
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,010
{\i1}You have nice childbearing hips.{\i0}

387
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,600
{\an8}{\i1}Wouldn't that actuallybe sexual harassment if I did?{\i0}

388
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:34,980
{\an8}LITTLE SISTER

389
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,180
{\i1}Like the other day...{\i0}

390
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,640
{\i1}Kei, isn't that skirt too short?{\i0}

391
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,320
{\i1}I'm not wearing this for you.That's sexual harassment. Drop dead.{\i0}

392
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,860
{\i1}I was just worried about heras a big brother!{\i0}

393
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,990
{\an8}{\i1}If there's a reaction from a personother than the person you want,{\i0}

394
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,370
{\an8}{\i1}it's sexual harassment.{\i0}

395
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,620
{\an8}{\i1}But since I did notice,I should say something, right?{\i0}

396
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,370
{\i1}I'm sure she won't be any crueler to methan my little sister was!{\i0}

397
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,500
{\an8}Fujiwara-senpai...

398
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,760
You changed your conditioner, didn't you?

399
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,970
You can tell?

400
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,260
Yeah, well...

401
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,260
{\an8}the smell is different than usual.

402
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,890
I mean, it is stuffy in here today,

403
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,770
but it's cute that the smellis stronger than usual.

404
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,860
It kind of smells like a baby.

405
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,400
Ishigami...

406
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,530
That's creepy!

407
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,620
{\an8}{\i1}Let me die.{\i0}

408
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,040
I want to die, so I'm going home.

409
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,790
S-Sure. But don't die.

410
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,960
{\i1}It smelled good,{\i0}

411
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,130
{\i1}so I meant to give her a compliment.{\i0}

412
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,260
Do I smell? Am I stinky?

413
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,680
{\i1}That's tough!{\i0}

414
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,010
{\i1}The day Shinomiya calls me creepy,I'm likely to choose death myself!{\i0}

415
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,020
{\an8}SNIFF SNIFF

416
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,020
{\i1}I'd better not bring up her nails!{\i0}

417
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,140
{\i1}It's just too risky!{\i0}

418
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,770
{\i1}I can't risk having her call me "creepy"!{\i0}

419
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,900
{\i1}Wait. Is that just an excuse?{\i0}

420
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,990
{\i1}This is my issue.{\i0}

421
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
{\i1}Complimenting Shinomiya's nails...{\i0}

422
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,710
{\i1}I'm just genuinely bashful.{\i0}

423
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,800
{\i1}In the end, he didn't notice my nails.{\i0}

424
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,720
{\i1}But it's probably better that way.{\i0}

425
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,270
{\i1}It's meaningless for meto be fashion-conscious.{\i0}

426
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,070
{\an8}{\i1}It doesn't make me cute.{\i0}

427
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,990
{\an8}Shinomiya!

428
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,820
{\an8}Those nails!

429
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,580
C-C-C-C-Cu...

430
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,170
{\an8}Never mind! Nothing!

431
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,210
What?

432
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,590
Finish what you were going to say!

433
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,180
The president is cutewhen he's all flustered, isn't he?

434
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,350
Jeez! Jeez!

435
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,350
{\an8}{\i1}You, too, Kaguya.{\i0}

436
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,020
{\an8}I-I wonder what he was about to say!

437
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,770
{\an8}What do you think, Hayasaka?

438
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,770
{\an8}"Hayasaka," I said!

439
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,360
{\an8}He said, "Those nails!"

440
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:29,870
{\an5}RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:KAGUYA WINS

441
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,360
{\i1}Results of today's match...{\i0}

442
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,700
{\an8}Come on, Hayasaka!

443
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,030
{\i1}Kaguya wins.{\i0}
