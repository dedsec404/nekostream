1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,860
The treasurer of the four-memberstudent council at Shuchiin Academy...

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,230
Yu Ishigami.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,580
The man who is indispensableto the student council,

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,200
yet hasn't mademuch of an impression on them.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,080
The man Shirogane,the president of the student council,

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,960
chose to be the treasurerbased on expectations of his prowess.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,000
Here's this month's financial report.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,750
Great.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,630
He has been biding his time...

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,630
What is it?

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,760
I want to quit the student council.

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,020
...waiting for the chanceto resign from the student council!

13
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,480
I see. Quit the student council...

14
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,240
YU ISHIGAMI WANTS TO LIVE

15
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,240
You've got to be kidding me!Without you, we'll go bankrupt!

16
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,740
I'm begging you here!

17
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,740
Yu Ishigami.

18
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,580
He's a data processing expert.

19
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,370
At Shuchiin Academy,only the president is elected.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,120
PRESIDENTMIYUKI SHIROGANE

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,620
VICE-PRESIDENTKAGUYA SHINOMIYA

22
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,750
SECRETARYCHIKA FUJIWARA

23
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,750
TREASURERYU ISHIGAMI

24
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,250
The other members are appointedbased on their abilities.

25
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,460
Yu Ishigami is a talented personwho was scouted by the student council...

26
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,760
despite the fact that he had barely begunhis first year there.

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,390
Normally he takes his work home

28
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,600
and only shows upin the student council room for meetings,

29
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,680
but he is a full-fledged council member.

30
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,440
Undeniably, Yu Ishigami is the treasurerof Shuchiin Academy's student council.

31
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,860
And now he is trying to quit his post.

32
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,280
But I've got an important reason.

33
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,030
That reason is...

34
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,030
What reason?

35
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,910
I think I'm going to be murdered.

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,950
Murdered?

37
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,790
I think Shinomiya-senpaiis going to kill me.

38
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,160
Shino...

39
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,160
O-On what basis do you think that?

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,920
Her eyes.

41
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,670
Eyes?

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,130
People's eyes are organsthat are connected directly to the brain.

43
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,420
Normally half of the brainis used to process the sense of sight.

44
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,510
The movement of eyes can showwhat someone is cautious about or hungry for.

45
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,560
Those organs clearly revealthe brain's activity.

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,560
FOOD > CATGLUTTON

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,560
DOG > FOODSCAREDY-CAT

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,940
I can tell five or six percent of a person'strue character just by looking into their eyes.

49
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,610
That's not much!

50
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,980
I can probably do the same!

51
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,700
The way Shinomiya-senpailooks at me sometimes...

52
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,370
I'm positive that the intent to killis in that glance.

53
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,700
What exactly happened?

54
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,000
It was a month ago.

55
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,590
COFFEE BLENDFREE TICKET

56
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,550
But a lot of people thinkthat's the best way to kill time.

57
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,720
What is this?

58
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,350
I don't really go to coffee shops.

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,640
They're too expensive for my blood.

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,730
You have a point.

61
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,730
If there was a coupon or something,it would be different.

62
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,990
PAT PAT

63
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,990
Yeah.

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,990
If it were cheaper,I wouldn't mind going once in a while.

65
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,460
Not a word to anyone about those tickets.

66
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,460
What happened?

67
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,590
She threatened me, so I can't tell you.

68
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,630
Threatened?

69
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,890
I have a feelingshe's killed two or three people already.

70
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,970
What happened?

71
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,390
And then last week, too...

72
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,690
Shinomiya-senpai,are you in love with the president?

73
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,980
FSSST

74
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,780
In love with the president?

75
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,320
Don't talk nonsense!That would never happen!

76
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,070
You don't see him as a love interest?

77
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,080
N-No!

78
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,410
Of course not.

79
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,200
Really?

80
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,170
In fact, rumors like that are a nuisance!

81
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,920
Is that right?

82
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,670
I thought they'd make a good couple.

83
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,220
Then I'll give the president a hintthat you have no romantic interest.

84
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,940
YANK YANK

85
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,520
You'll tell him no such thing!

86
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,940
You hear me?

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,690
I think she has the skillsof a trained assassin.

88
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,940
A trained assassin?

89
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,490
Using the corner of a couchto strangle me... That's a pro!

90
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,820
What do you think Shinomiya is?

91
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:56,080
SHIVER SHIVER

92
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,080
My guess is she's a natural-born serial killer.

93
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,950
I can see it in her eyes.

94
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,080
You put too much faithin that five or six percent!

95
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,460
Fujiwara-senpai'sin even more danger than me.

96
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,500
Sometimes Shinomiya-senpai staresat her as if she's less than human.

97
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,010
I estimate she's gotanother two months left.

98
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,630
You calculated her life expectancy?

99
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,590
Ridiculous!

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,720
No, that typeis the most dangerous predator.

101
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,100
President...

102
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,100
Is Ishigami here?

103
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,730
I was at a meeting.

104
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,860
Don't make it worse for yourself!

105
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,860
It was about the budgetfor the drama club.

106
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,690
Turn yourself in, Shinomiya!

107
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,150
Please!

108
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,360
Listen when someone's talking to you!

109
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,620
BEND BEND

110
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,830
I told you I was helpingthe drama club, remember?

111
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,210
Today was the costume fitting.

112
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,880
O-Oh.

113
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,130
Still, you didn't needto bring that prop in here.

114
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,380
Um, I just wantedto tease you a little with it.

115
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,010
Sorry.

116
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,470
Cute.

117
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,350
Shirogane-senpai, this is a trap.

118
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,520
She's playing it cuteso you'll let your guard down.

119
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,610
D-Don't scare me like that!

120
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,900
That's just a costume!Shinomiya hasn't killed anyone!

121
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,110
President!

122
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,780
Help.

123
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,330
Miss Kaguya killed me!

124
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Then it's true!

125
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,790
What's true?She's just wearing special makeup!

126
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,340
Oh, right!

127
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,090
No, President. This is a trap, too.

128
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,090
I suspect she really is dead,

129
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,010
but Shinomiya-senpai performedsome mad-science surgery on her.

130
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,600
Ishigami...

131
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,350
You always let imaginationget the better of you.

132
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,600
Shinomiya would never murder a soul.

133
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,230
Try to have more faith in your colleagues.

134
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,610
Okay?

135
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,610
Faith in my colleagues...

136
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,530
Anyway, that's impressive.

137
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,610
I know, right?

138
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,370
How is that attached?

139
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,740
It's like this. See?

140
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,330
Sorry I asked.

141
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,290
Faith in my colleagues...

142
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,830
Ishigami...

143
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,500
About our secret...

144
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,590
I appreciate that you've kept it to yourself.

145
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,140
Being tight-lipped is a virtue, right?

146
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,640
If you had blabbed...

147
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,230
Faith!

148
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,190
STAB

149
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,400
...this wouldn't be a toy.

150
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,280
Also, don't put the president in a bind.

151
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,610
Please don't sayanything more about resigning.

152
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,700
Do you want to trystabbing me, President?

153
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,830
Then was she...

154
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,160
Can I? I wanted to try it once.

155
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,540
listening the whole time?

156
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,930
RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:ISHIGAMI LOSES

157
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Results of today's match...

158
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,930
WANTS TO QUIT BECAUSEHE'S AFRAID OF KAGUYABUT CAN'T QUIT BECAUSEHE'S AFRAID OF KAGUYA

159
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,930
Ishigami loses.

160
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,930
WOMEN WHO LOVE AND HATE

161
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,690
CAGE FOR CATS

162
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,690
There's an animal cage in front of you.

163
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,690
How many cats are in the cage?

164
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,820
What kind of abstract question is that?

165
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,780
CHIKA FUJIWARAWANTS TO TEST YOU

166
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,150
It's a psychological test!

167
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,530
It's from a bookI borrowed from the library.

168
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,740
Just by answering this question,

169
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,450
I'll be able to understandthe depths of your mind, President.

170
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,290
That's silly.

171
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,420
As if you could understand the workingsof the mind with a question like that.

172
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,420
Come on, just humor me.

173
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,300
How many cats?

174
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,260
I guess about nine cats.

175
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,800
That tells mehow many children you want!

176
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,810
That's exactly right!

177
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,560
Nine kids? That's like a baseball team!

178
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,560
Nine kids? That many?

179
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,690
PSYCHOLOGY TEST

180
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,560
Psychology tests.

181
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,690
Abstract questions that draw outwhat someone really thinks.

182
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,070
Most of them have amusing game elementsthat employ the Barnum effect,

183
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,610
but some of them are practicaland based on actual psychology.

184
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,490
The person who thinks of these testsonly as an amusing trifle

185
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,580
and lets their guard downmay be in for a bitter experience.

186
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,210
I've got another really interesting one!

187
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,130
Let's do it together!

188
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,550
Oh, us, too?

189
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,340
Yes!

190
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,720
Are you ready?

191
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,090
"You're walking down a dark path.

192
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,220
Suddenly, someone taps youon the shoulder from behind.

193
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,430
Who is that person?"

194
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,140
Give me a hint.

195
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,900
This isn't a quiz,so it doesn't work that way.

196
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,730
Oh.

197
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,110
A dark path...

198
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,940
What could this be getting at?

199
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,030
There it is!The second question on page 47!

200
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,240
That answer...

201
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,740
THAT'S THE PERSON YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH!!

202
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,740
indicates whom you're in love with!

203
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,080
If you say the nameof someone of the opposite sex

204
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,500
it's like a confession of love!

205
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,250
As is often the case,Kaguya had prepared for this situation.

206
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,750
PLEASE TYPE IN A NAME

207
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,750
CHIKA FUJIWARA'S BRAIN

208
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Kaguya has known Chika Fujiwarasince middle school

209
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,510
and is especially familiarwith her behavioral patterns.

210
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,510
CHIKA'S BRAIN

211
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,510
LOVE, PLAYING, EATING, PESU

212
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,220
Ever since Kaguya noticedthe book was on the library's list of purchases,

213
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,020
she predicted a high likelihood of Fujiwarabringing it to the student council room.

214
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,020
PSYCHOLOGY TESTS FOR LOVE

215
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,770
Kaguya read the book in advance!

216
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,860
"Question. You bring a squirrel home.

217
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,030
She's able to avoid any dangerous answers.

218
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,030
What do you do with it then?"

219
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,490
Let's see. I would makedelicious food for it every day...

220
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,950
and give it a massagebefore it went to sleep.

221
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,620
The answer is...

222
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,200
"After you get married,what will you do for your spouse?"

223
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,210
In other words,

224
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,870
by being able to negotiate this minefieldcalled a "psychological test,"

225
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,460
she holds a huge advantage.

226
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,210
Let me think.It would be you, Miss Fujiwara.

227
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,760
M-Me?

228
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,680
BASHFUL BASHFUL

229
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,550
A dark path...

230
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,690
Why are you running away, Ishigami?

231
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,860
My answer is Shinomiya-senpai.

232
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,030
Me?

233
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,200
That's how Ishigami feels?

234
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,410
He's a nice boy, and I don't dislike him...

235
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,000
but I'm sorry.Ishigami is on the level of a worm to me.

236
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,960
Ishigami is rejected.

237
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,300
Now the president is the real issue.

238
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,720
I hate dark, scary places.

239
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,680
President, let's go home together.

240
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,180
Well, I—

241
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,100
Grin!

242
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,360
Wait! Why is Fujiwaragrinning at me like that?

243
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,360
GRIN GRIN

244
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,900
She called it "really interesting."

245
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,280
A questionthat love-obsessed girl pounced on...

246
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,410
This one is definitely not a harmless test!

247
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,160
If the answer is"The person you're in love with..."

248
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,580
Oh, President...

249
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,870
So, you're subconsciouslyin love with me?

250
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,330
How cute.

251
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,250
It would be like a confession of love!

252
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,470
The best answer would be someone they'd besatisfied with, but nobody in this room!

253
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,760
Then...

254
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,510
I guess my little sister.

255
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,890
"The person who taps you on the shoulderindicates the person you're in love with."

256
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,520
In short, the presidenthas a sister complex.

257
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,360
That's the most boring answer.

258
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,530
That's right. I have a sister complex.

259
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,780
I'm in love with Shinomiya-senpai?

260
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,620
No, I think this emotion is terror!

261
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,540
President, I think I haveStockholm syndrome, so I'm going home.

262
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,550
A-All right. Get well soon.

263
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,180
It could also bethe suspension bridge effect.

264
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,430
I'll go to a hospital on the way home.

265
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,600
I wanna try answering one myself,so I'll look on the net.

266
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,190
Shoot! Miss Fujiwara is lookingfor a question outside of the book!

267
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,520
This one's cute!

268
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,400
"You're in a field of flowers.

269
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,360
The owner said you can take homeas many flowers as you like.

270
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,570
How many will you take home?"

271
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,280
A question she doesn't know the answer to!

272
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,040
Flowers, huh?

273
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,120
I'd carefully pick only the prettiest ones.

274
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,380
So just a couple.

275
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:27,170
I-I suppose I'd take enoughto make a lovely bouquet.

276
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,760
I see.

277
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,850
What should I do?I answered honestly without thinking!

278
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
How many for you, President?

279
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,350
Well, unlike that last one,I don't have to say a name,

280
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,850
so I can answer it normally.

281
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,650
I can take as many as I likefor free, right?

282
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,690
Then there's only one possible answer.

283
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:51,200
HEAP

284
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,990
I'd take as manyas I could cram into a truck!

285
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,200
Maybe even a truck wouldn't be enough.

286
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,450
That's a poor person's mentality.

287
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,580
What would you dowith all of those flowers?

288
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,710
Well, I could give some awayand sell some, right?

289
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,210
Um, the answer is...

290
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:00,580
CLICK HERE FOR THE ANSWER

291
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,710
THE AMOUNT OF FLOWERS YOU TOOK INDICATESHOW MUCH LOVE YOU HAVE FOR A SPECIAL SOMEONE!

292
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,180
What was the answer?

293
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,100
Nothing. Um, "How muchyou love flowers" or something.

294
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,060
Yes, that's what it was.

295
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,190
Even though I love flowers?

296
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,610
Silly.

297
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,860
I don't agree with that one!

298
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,900
Neither do I.

299
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,160
But that's what the answer was.We just have to accept it.

300
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,370
REASON:HAVING A TRUCK FULL OF LOVE

301
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,860
Results of today's match...

302
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,370
Shirogane loses.

303
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,370
I guess you're right.

304
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,870
COST OF A FAMILY

305
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,870
UM, IF YOU GET A HCG INJECTION,THERE'S A 20% HIGHER CHANCEOF GIVING BIRTH TO TWINS...

306
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,870
AH... HUH...

307
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,370
Wanna get a smoothie on the way home?

308
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,040
Okay!

309
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,250
- I'm gonna get celery!- What kind should I get?

310
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,220
I'm totally sorry.

311
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,010
I'm working again today.I have to go straight there.

312
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,430
Again?

313
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,930
You work too much.

314
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,060
Next time, definitely!

315
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,060
Yeah, okay!

316
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,770
It's time to go home, Lady Kaguya.

317
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,280
Hayasaka, I told you not to cometo the student council room.

318
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,410
I've confirmed that the presidentand the other members have already left.

319
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,490
KAGUYA WANTSTO BE NOTICED

320
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,660
Rest assured.

321
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,370
Carelessness like that can be fatal.

322
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,040
Recently, you've become lax, haven't you?

323
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,250
Between your appearance,those nails,

324
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,090
UNBUTTONEDHERCOLLAR

325

MYSTERIOUSKEYCHAIN

327
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,840
and your skirt length,you're likely violating school rules.

328
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,840
ROLLED UP HER SKIRT

329
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,800
It's all within the boundsof school regulations.

330
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,220
Although you could sayI'm bending the rules a bit.

331
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,800
A bit.

332
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,010
For us, beauty is power.

333
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,810
BEAUTY IS LIVE AMMO

334
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,520
High society is not for peoplewithout adornment.

335
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,820
You don't want opportunities stolen by womenwith only good looks going for them.

336
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,690
I would say you're too stuffy about it,Lady Kaguya.

337
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,030
Lately, lightly polished nailsare even in style here.

338
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,330
If you want men to think you're cute,you should take an interest.

339
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,210
Really? Then will the president...

340
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,580
I mean, will boys think I'm cute?

341
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,340
After all this time, I'm surprisedyou haven't given yourself away.

342
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,340
But, yes, of course.

343
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,340
Hayasaka realized that nails had little to dowith popularity amongst the opposite sex.

344
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,930
Boys will...

345
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,970
Come on. Let's go home and paint your nails.

346
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,650
But she gave only vague answersin her desire to give Kaguya some glam.

347
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,850
Are you sure about this?

348
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,020
It's okay.

349
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,650
What's okay? Hey!

350
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,230
THE NEXT DAY

351
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,240
Gel nails which don't infringeon the school dress code.

352
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,070
The modesty of rhinestone onlyon each ring finger was part of the appeal.

353
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
I wonder what the president will think.

354
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,750
Will he think it's cute?

355
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,000
Or maybe he'll think it's frivolous.

356
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,170
What's the nail polish about?

357
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,920
I know.

358
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,600
I don't want it in that case.

359
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,640
I'll just go home today, and...

360
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,890
What are you doing, Shinomiya?

361
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,900
Aren't you going in?

362
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,860
Well, I was on my way in!

363
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,780
Miss Kaguya!

364
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,070
About this part...

365
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,660
Yes, what is it?

366
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,910
Are you hiding something behind you?

367
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,120
No, nothing.

368
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,210
The only times she's quick on the uptakeare situations like this!

369
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,760
If someone's going to notice,I want it to be the president.

370
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,550
Certainly not her!

371
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,260
I have to get closer.

372
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,850
Here, President.The minutes from our last meeting.

373
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,560
Oh, thanks.

374
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Stare.

375
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,820
And there's an error here.

376
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,940
You're right.

377
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,700
Indeed.

378
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,950
Good eye!

379
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,450
He didn't notice!

380
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,200
Shinomiya is being fashionable!

381
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
Jeez, why?

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,210
Is it because you're not interested in me?

383
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,250
What caused the change?

384
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,720
She's always avoided ornamentation,saying, "Does a swan dress up?"

385
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,720
What should I do?Should I mention it?

386
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,010
You have nice childbearing hips.

387
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,600
Wouldn't that actuallybe sexual harassment if I did?

388
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:34,980
LITTLE SISTER

389
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,180
Like the other day...

390
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,640
Kei, isn't that skirt too short?

391
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,320
I'm not wearing this for you.That's sexual harassment. Drop dead.

392
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,860
I was just worried about heras a big brother!

393
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,990
If there's a reaction from a personother than the person you want,

394
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,370
it's sexual harassment.

395
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,620
But since I did notice,I should say something, right?

396
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,370
I'm sure she won't be any crueler to methan my little sister was!

397
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,500
Fujiwara-senpai...

398
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,760
You changed your conditioner, didn't you?

399
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,970
You can tell?

400
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,260
Yeah, well...

401
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,260
the smell is different than usual.

402
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,890
I mean, it is stuffy in here today,

403
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,770
but it's cute that the smellis stronger than usual.

404
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,860
It kind of smells like a baby.

405
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,400
Ishigami...

406
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,530
That's creepy!

407
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,620
Let me die.

408
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,040
I want to die, so I'm going home.

409
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,790
S-Sure. But don't die.

410
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,960
It smelled good,

411
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,130
so I meant to give her a compliment.

412
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,260
Do I smell? Am I stinky?

413
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,680
That's tough!

414
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,010
The day Shinomiya calls me creepy,I'm likely to choose death myself!

415
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,020
SNIFF SNIFF

416
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,020
I'd better not bring up her nails!

417
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,140
It's just too risky!

418
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,770
I can't risk having her call me "creepy"!

419
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,900
Wait. Is that just an excuse?

420
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,990
This is my issue.

421
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
Complimenting Shinomiya's nails...

422
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,710
I'm just genuinely bashful.

423
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,800
In the end, he didn't notice my nails.

424
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,720
But it's probably better that way.

425
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,270
It's meaningless for meto be fashion-conscious.

426
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,070
It doesn't make me cute.

427
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,990
Shinomiya!

428
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,820
Those nails!

429
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,580
C-C-C-C-Cu...

430
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,170
Never mind! Nothing!

431
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,210
What?

432
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,590
Finish what you were going to say!

433
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,180
The president is cutewhen he's all flustered, isn't he?

434
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,350
Jeez! Jeez!

435
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,350
You, too, Kaguya.

436
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,020
I-I wonder what he was about to say!

437
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,770
What do you think, Hayasaka?

438
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,770
"Hayasaka," I said!

439
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,360
He said, "Those nails!"

440
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:29,870
RESULTS OF TODAY'S MATCH:KAGUYA WINS

441
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,360
Results of today's match...

442
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,700
Come on, Hayasaka!

443
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,030
Kaguya wins.
